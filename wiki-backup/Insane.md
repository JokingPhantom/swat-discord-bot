# Insane Difficulty

![](Difficulty-insane.gif "Difficulty-insane.gif")

*This has a steep raise in difficulty from [Hard](Hard "wikilink")
Difficulty. It is a very tough difficulty that is aimed at making decent
players into good players. (Not to be confused with pros.)*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Required Objectives

-   3 Reactors restored
    -   Only 3 Reactors are revealed at start instead of all 6 like
        lower difficulties
    -   Revealed Reactors will always be 2 Badly Damaged and 1 Severely
        Damaged.
    -   Reactors will always be 1 regular Damaged, 3 Badly Damaged, and
        2 Severely Damaged.

<!-- -->

-   20 Civilians Rescued
-   Reduce Radiation to 15

## "Perfect" Objectives

*Must "overachieve" at least two of the three objectives listed below
and sell Hazmat before 62 minutes.*

-   6 reactors restored
-   32 Civilians Rescued
-   Reduce Radiation to 0
-   [Hazmat](Hazmat "wikilink") Objective **must** be completed.

## More Information

-   Beating Insane unlocks Rank 10.
-   Beating "Perfect Insane" unlocks Rank 11, allowing for
    [Nightmare](Nightmare "wikilink") difficulty.
-   Additional LAD has a 100% of spawning in rooms.
-   2nd A.T.M.E has a 100% of spawning.
-   100% Chance of at least 1 Hazmats spawning in grave yard.
-   Mobs come very fast and get stronger much faster.
-   New command: -perfect : This command enforces "perfect" conditions
    and will not give a victory to the players until either the game is
    beaten "perfectly" or the time passes over 62 minutes and then
    beaten normally. This command requires Rank 7 or above to use, and a
    majority (\>50%) must vote -perfect.
-   If you do not have enough Rank 7+ people to vote for -perfect, you
    can still do perfect insane by over-achieving two objectives and
    selling the hazmat before normal-completing the third objective.

## Hints and Tips

-   This difficulty is for experienced players only. There is a gap
    between players who can beat insane and beat it "perfectly".
-   If you can't hold your own in this difficulty, make it a huge
    priority to stay with the group and stay alive.
-   Make a class call before the game gets started. You never want to
    start an insane and realize that you have 4 snipers, no tank, and no
    medic.
-   You want to level around 10 until you start to move. Camp near the
    starting bunker or the graveyard to get levels before the boss
    comes.
-   Scouts are very nice, both for items, rads, and the first APC of
    civs. A good solo sniper will perform all of these.
-   Snipers should lay plenty of cameras for vision. This will help
    [tacts](Tactician "wikilink"), [demos](Demolitions "wikilink"), and
    [psys](Psychologist "wikilink") with ions, nukes, and mind slay/rot
    targets.
-   Sometimes a properly aimed nuke early game will get you 1-2 levels.
    This can be beneficial in certain cases.
-   Make sure you have taken skills early - although this will leave you
    with less protection (Nanites), it will make you more able to crowd
    control effectively.
-   In perfect insane, use the -time command, and keep on your toes. You
    have a time limit, and time is against you - mobs get prohibitively
    strong and fast late game.
-   Make sure you camp after completing objectives. You don't want too
    many tyrants/bosses on the field at once for a long period of time.
    Failure to camp may lead to multi-boss / tyrant encounters that are
    dangerous.
-   If your team decides to camp, it is best to do so on a choke point
    where zombies come from minimal directions. Only from 1 direction is
    most desirable.
