## Hints and Tips

-   It's not too hard, stick together and work as a team and you can
    almost always win even if it's your first time.
-   Use Nanites. They aren't critical for winning, especially on normal,
    but if you are new to the game, they will save your life many times
    from bosses or rad zombies.
-   Get a little experience before you go around completing objectives.
-   Try not to be too hard on first time players - you don't want to
    discourage people from just enjoying the game.
-   Try to be friendly - you can teach a lot of things in one normal
    game. Then advise them to go to the channel SWAT if they want to
    play more difficult games with more experienced people.

## Guides

*There doesn't necessarily need to be a guide on this. Maybe write a few
things on a Guide to doing Normal with noobs or something.*
