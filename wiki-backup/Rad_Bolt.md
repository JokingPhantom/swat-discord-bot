Zombies, Ghouls, and Gargoyles can all spawn holding a rad, allowing
them to fire Rad Bolts at heroes that perform any hostile action.

Rad Bolts do Radiation type damage, and take 25 mana to cast.

Horror Rad Bolts do 800 in Normal, Hard, and Insane difficulty, and
1200 in Nightmare, Extinction, and Survival.

Grotlings that spawn from Super Gargoyles only do 400 damage, and take
20 mana to cast. They usually do not have time or the radiation bracket
to generate sufficient mana to cast Rad Bolt.

| Type      | Damage |
|-----------|--------|
| Regular   | 1000   |
| Grotling  | 400    |
| Horror(1) | 800   |
| Horror(2) | 1200   |
