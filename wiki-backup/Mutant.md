are stong melee units that have a high defensive power.// Mutants are
powerful defensive units that not only are powerful against weaker
damage things like splash and the flamethrower and chaingun, but also
vary in difficulty according to the radiation level. They are indeed
huge priorities for long range units to take down before the tank,
usually a chaingunner, has to fight him as he can't damage it
effectively. Mutants are more likely to spawn at higher radiation
levels. [\#skills](#skills "wikilink")

Skin:\*\* The Mutant has such tough skin that each shot is reduced by 45
damage, to a minimum of 6. This is particularly bad for the chaingun,
who loses somewhere around 90% of their base damage because of an 48.5
average base damage. Flamethrowers are adversely affected as well, but
the minimum means each shot will deal 6 damage, only a 40% reduction
from the base. Unupgraded ARs suffer a penalty similar to flamethrowers,
but this percent-of-damage-reduced decreases with points into RR instead
of increasing, as points in Adv. Fuel does. Plasma Round damage is still
reduced by Hardened Skin, but because all of bonus damage from Plasma
Rounds is above the reduction, the skill provides a huge advantage for
chainguns versus mutants.

Mutants have a chance to stun on each attack. The duration and chance
seems to be affected by radiation.

## Variants

[image:charred.jpg
align="left"](image:charred.jpg_align="left" "wikilink")//Charred
Mutants// are tinted black. They are significantly stronger than a
normal mutant and should have special attention when they attack the
group. They are much more powerful in terms of damage and effective
health. They can stun the SWAT team so are particularly threatening to
lighter armor types who then cannot run away. Their most lethal ability
is their multiple lives coupled with revenge AI. The charred mutant will
hunt down whichever hero takes one of the Charred Mutant's lives, either
until it loses another life (and thus switches targets) or until the
hero or charred dies. Each life removes almost any debuffs the mutant
had. The number of lives for a charred depends on player count and uber.

## Notes

//How to effectively Kill Mutants.// \> Because of Mutants' hardened
skin, they should be killed by high-damage and armor-ignoring weapons.
\> \> //Charred Mutants// ("charreds") - There are two good ways to take
down charred mutants. If any life of the charred is finished off by
Psychologist's mind slay or pyro's microwave then it is dead for good -
charreds are the single most important targets for these two skills. \>
If your team is unfortunate enough not to have one of these class then
charreds can become more difficult. The freeze ray can take off lives,
but will not entirely prevent reanimation. One of the freeze ray's two
effects does remain on a charred after reanimation, the only debuff to
carry between lives. Any slow effect, especially ones that remain on the
ground (as opposed to concussion grenade and cluster rockets) will help
control the charred. They should be killed by someone from range,
allowing enough distance for someone else to kill the charred and bring
it back another direction. This kill-to-bounce method is much more
difficult than normal mob bouncing and requires more team coordination.
\> Cluster rockets are technically cast by a neutral unit for game
mechanic reasons, thus cluster rocket kills will not trigger the revenge
AI and the charred will be susceptible to the normal rules of aggo. \>
\> The best way to deal with mutants is to prevent them in the first
place by keeping rads low. \>
