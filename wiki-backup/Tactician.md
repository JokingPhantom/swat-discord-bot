### [Weakpoint Tactic](image:ability-weak.gif "wikilink") [Weakpoint Tactic](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tact#.htmweak)

[right](file:tooltip-weakpoint.jpg "wikilink")

> When using Weakpoint, make sure you stay near the mob so that the
> party can reap the full benefits of your aura.

> Weakpoint has a range of 625, which means that you will be hugging the
> tank most of the time to max it's effectiveness.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Blitz Tactic](file:ability-blitz.gif "wikilink") [Blitz Tactic](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tact.htm#blitz)

[right](file:tooltip-blitz.jpg "wikilink")

> This aura works on robotics units as well, significantly strengthening
> the [LAD](LAD "wikilink") 'deathball'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Endurance Tactic](file:ability-endur.gif "wikilink") [Endurance Tactic](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tact.htm#endur)

[right](file:tooltip-endo.jpg "wikilink")

> When playing in higher difficulty games, this skill is commonly not
> leveled past 8 skill points.

> To maximize effectiveness of this skill, make sure you stay near the
> back of the party when moving so that the slower moving players can
> catch up via the speed boost from the aura.

> This ability can stack up to 4 times with other tacticians.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

> One Aura at a time can be prioritized by clicking on the skill or
> hotkey. This will take half of the skill points from the other two
> auras (rounded down), and apply them to the prioritized aura.
> Prioritization will only take a maximum of 8 points from other auras
> to apply to the prioritized aura.

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

## Innate Abilities

### [Pep Talk](image:ability-pep.gif "wikilink") [Pep Talk](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tact.htm#pep)

### [Ion Strike](image:ability-ion.gif "wikilink") [Ion Strike](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tact.htm#ion)

[right](file:tooltip-ion.jpg "wikilink")

> Line up your mouse cursor on the minimap during a global rad scan to
> hit far away rads.

> Check any ioned rooms for items, crates or rads.

> After the [rescue civilians objective](civs "wikilink") has been
> completed ion strikes will target rads. A warning message appears when
> a civilian ion strike will occur near you. These also target rad
> holding units (rad zombies, Horrors etc.) so beware of ion strikes
> when fighting these units.

> Ioning a pile of bodies will prevent future animation, granting one
> additional kill per body that could have revived.

> Ion's high damage is extremely useful against bosses and high priority
> targets, especially if you can hit them on the move.

> ioned will not have any energy.

> when you are focused on the lab.

## Good Builds

*The recommended way to play Tactician.*

*Suggested Traits*: , , , , depending on what the team needs. , , or
work for more skill points

*Suggested Specs*: , ,

*Suggested Talents*:

-   First points: 1 Blitz, 1 Endurance, rest into Nanites
-   Get to 10 effective Nanites.
-   Max Blitz
-   Max Endurance
-   Excess points to Nanites
-   Excess points into Weakpoint/Refined Rifle

Recruit a Cadet ASAP and keep it alive. Give it a Kevlar for some armor.
Kevlar is required to purchase the Shield Capacitor upgrade on the
Cadet, giving it +250 energy cap and Medium Nanites (Heavy Nanites if
Extinction).

When the team is moving, prioritize Endurance. Otherwise prioritize
Blitz.

Stand within melee range of LADs, Mini MK2s, Cadet, Watchmen, and other
team members to give them triple the normal Blitz attack speed boost,
thereby maximizing team damage output.

### Battle Tact

Author: Valcrist77

*Suggested Traits*: . , , or work for more skill points.

*Suggested Specs*:

*Suggested Talents*:

-   Keep rifle at twice Weakpoint until both are maxed. Spare points go
    into 8 Endurance and Max Nanites, then more Endurance.
-   Prioritize to get level 16 Weakpoint (requires 16 even points in
    other auras), stay within 625 range of all your targets.

Recruit a woman ASAP to maximize attack speed.

You will have to play much closer to the action, and reposition
aggressively to make use of Weakpoint due to its short range. Since it
is an aura, in old versions of Warcraft 3 it may take up to a second to
apply to in range targets. Latest updates to the Warcraft 3 engine have
greatly shortened the delay of aura applying to moving targets, though
it still shortens the range slightly.

## More Information

### Hints/Tips

-   Use Pep Talk during any period of combat. The damage boost is nice
    and the armor boost can save lives.
-   Use Rad Away on allies and self whenever passive radiation damage is
    present (especially early game), or when facing a Horror or Nemesis.
    Prioritize units with weaker Nanites. Rad Away fragile people in
    case of rad bolts.
-   It is by design Ion Strike does not have aoe cursor.
-   Blitz is the most reliable aura, since it has a large range and
    affects allies, which are usually always in range.
-   Weakpoint is the strongest aura for crowd control, but has a short
    range that is nearly half that of most long range weapons on the
    team. Potent if used correctly when the team is swarmed by large
    amounts of high hp mob at close range and from multiple directions -
    otherwise Blitz should be favored.
-   Weakpoint aura does not stack. With multiple Tacticians, only one
    Tactician should Prioritize max Weakpoint.
-   Ion far away and isolated rooms early to scout (allow sniper to
    teleport potentially important items).
-   Ion Strike can be used to defeat bosses or minibosses. Choosing
    between boss damage and hunting rads/scouting rooms will depend on
    the need.
-   Slow, immobile, or predictable targets are easier to hit with Ion
    Strike, so ask your team to slow down or tank priority targets to
    make it easier.
-   Commandos will try to run away if targeted by a nearby Ion Strike.
    Slow or stun them to prevent them from running. They will not run
    away from Ion Strikes if they are far enough away, so you can hit
    them if they walk into them from a distance.
-   All zombies hit by an Ion Strike, dead or alive, will disintegrate
    preventing reanimation. Alive zombies will turn black, dead zombies
    will turn whiter than other dead zombies. Use in higher game modes
    to assist in running away after camping and use on a location where
    there are a lot of corpses. Especially useful when fighting Nemesis
    to give the team a break from respawning zombies.
-   Ioning corpse piles can actually be an experience *loss* on higher
    difficulties as zombies frequently have multiple lives while ioning
    only gives one life worth of experience.
-   Rad Resistant Trait upgrades the effectiveness of your radiation
    scanner. This synergizes well with ion and allows you to eliminate
    hard to reach rad fragments while not impacting the fallout meter.
    The targeting cursor can be positioned directly on mini map pings to
    reliably hit rads.
