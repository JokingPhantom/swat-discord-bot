*Sludges* are a new boss added in version P120506 and can spawn in any
difficulty. The boss is similar to a spider boss as it can burrow and
use similar abilities. Sludges award 3 valor points per hero until the
valor pool is depleted.

## Skills:

-   Impale: The sludge throws the targets in a line up in the air
    stunning them.

<!-- -->

-   Burrow: Allows the sludge to burrow underground and send up his
    tentacles to trap and attack the team. The sludge is still allowed
    to attack heroes from underground biting at their ankles and causing
    quite a bit of damage.

<!-- -->

-   Tremor: All large bosses do not attack C4 and Claymores, but their
    heavy footsteps do damage to nearby C4 and Claymores.

<!-- -->

-   True Sight: All bosses have truesight in a large radius.

## Tentacles

After the sludge boss burrows underground, it spawns it's tentacles to
deal the with group. This cause a decent amount of damage and shouldn't
be taken lightly.

-   Entangle: Upon attack, the tentacles can entangle you in place. This
    can be dispelled by sprinting, recall, and watchman partner
    teleport.

## Hints/Tips

Use Adrenaline on a hero with a sniper rifle to quickly take this boss
down. Kamikazi hyperthrash, Watchman laser, or accelerated HO with
minidroids will also be able to bring down this boss with no problem.
Pheroing the tenticles once a sludge burrows is one of the most
important parts of this encounter.

Target each tentacle one at a time, the faster you get the number of
them down, the better chances you have to survive.

Get bats to the borg once you know this boss spawned or once you see it.
The borg will need to try and hold agro by pheroing them several times,
and tanking the amount of damage they dole out will require at least one
stack of batteries to succeed (depending on game time and current uber.)

==<Notes:==> Sludges will be tracked via satellite once 3 reactors have
been powered in all difficulties below Extinction. An announcement with
minimap ping will always warn you when a boss spawns, but the same
announcement is made for all large bosses.

Dogs cannot evade boss hits. (Bosses do 0 radius splash damage to
mechanical units)
