# Extinction Difficulty

![](Difficulty-extinction.gif "Difficulty-extinction.gif")

*This is the hardest difficulty for SWAT, and it is extremely difficult.
This is for Pros only. Requires all Rank 12 Characters to play.*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Required Objectives

-   6 Reactors restored
    -   Only 3 Reactors are revealed at start.
    -   Revealed Reactors will always be 2 Badly Damaged and 1 Severely
        Damaged.
    -   Reactors will always be 1 regular Damaged, 3 Badly Damaged, and
        2 Severely Damaged.
-   32 Civilians Rescued
-   Reduce Radiation to 0
    -   Super Radiation Fragment (SRad) spawns near ground zero with
        60,000 hit points and extremely high health regeneration. It
        increases the rad counter incrementally until destroyed. As time
        goes on, it becomes easier to kill.
-   Sell all Hazmat
    -   Hazmat will spawn in multiple rooms and graveyard.

## Hints and Tips

    get discouraged - this is meant to be tough.

## Guides

Valcrist77's General Extinction Guide:

1.  Rush a Reactor if it is nearby or on the path to the Graveyard.
    Severely damaged Reactors can be filled if the team is big or
    possesses extra energy abilities (Cyborg, Pyro, Energizer, etc).
    Remake if the Reactor explodes.
2.  Hack unused LAD parts, or other low value items to get enough money
    for a Recall (1000). Hazard pay comes at 5 minutes. Solo, short
    scouter, or group can buy it, which ever is most convenient.
3.  Rush to the Graveyard, spawn it ASAP, and camp down the mob. Get
    levels for the entire team.
4.  Call the first APC at 6 min. Can wait till 6:40 for 2nd set of
    dotes, if Recall is not available.
5.  Complete all objectives
    -   Continuously call APCs. If they are close by, do them. Televacs
        are a more flexible way to rescue Civilians after power is
        restored.
    -   To prepare for Reactors, lay Claymores and walk the distance to
        delay the mob. High mobility/firepower units can also assist in
        holding off mob long enough for the Reactor to be filled safely.
    -   Path to the closest completable objective, or unexplored parts
        of the map. Path away from the mob in a circular route around
        the map if unable to push through them. Pushing through mob
        requires the use of borg phero, dog draw, Alice Warp, and/or
        high firepower.
    -   The solo/short scouts should path to unexplored rooms, or known
        rooms of interest (items, rads, Fungals, Hazmat). Path away from
        the mob chasing the group unless you are clearing already opened
        item rooms while invisible, and there are no sources of true
        sight around. Tyrants and bosses become much more frequent as
        the game goes on, so pathing behind the group after 30 minutes
        should only be done with an reliable escape.
    -   Eliminate Red Rads if it is safe and convenient to do so. Try to
        keep effective rads below 25 before killing a red rad - the
        spawned radlets will last for several minutes. It is easier to
        deal with high radiation when camping or doing civs, while it is
        harder when filling Reactors.
    -   SRAD can be done after 40 minutes with an average amount of
        firepower. HO/alice with stims/fully built LADs constitute
        enough firepower to take it earlier. Claymores can be laid to
        delay the mob while the group takes the SRAD. It becomes a
        significant source of radiation after 50 minutes, and should be
        done no later than 60 min, or the mob will become significantly
        strongly and more costly to deal with.
    -   Partial Power and 20 civs rescued (government ion) should be top
        priorities.
    -   Partial Power allows for ABMs to be hacked, Hazmats to be sold,
        drugs/revives to be bought, and batteries in ABMs to be bought
        so that the ABM can recharge its stock of batteries. These
        bonuses are generally more effective than earlier civs, and
        should be priorities before reaching Government Ion. Do civs if
        unable to safely complete a Reactor.
    -   Government Ion helps keeps rads down. When rads are low, it can
        also function to eliminate the rads on the map entirely, and
        save the team resources dedicated to rad hunting.
    -   Chronotech's item crate will spawn at a random time, in a random
        spot in the park. It has 2500 HP and high regen - you'll need a
        fair bit of firepower to open it: Ion, Xnade, XLR8, stims,
        Alice, etc.
    -   You can hold off on selling the last hazmat, completing the last
        Reactor, or rescuing the last civilian to delay the spawning of
        Nemesis, if you need to setup anything or accumulate more
        resources to ensure victory.
6.  Defeat Nemesis
    -   Neutralize Nemesis with the Force Field Neutralizer (max 500e
        per hero usage). It takes 12500e. Reactors will contribute their
        own current energy if within range (2700), up to their max of
        4000e. Path accordingly.
    -   Bring down Nemesis to 66% HP to trigger Sleep + permanent rads
        equivalent to an alive Horror.
    -   Bring down Nemesis to 33% HP to trigger Energy Drain (wimps).
        All units will have their energy drained to 0 within a couple of
        seconds - drop batteries to avoid triggering them and burning
        them uselessly. Tank with something until the main tank with can
        pick up batteries and be ready to tank.
    -   Bring down Nemesis to 25% HP to trigger Phase. Nemesis will
        perform "Know Your Name" shortly after: Nemesis will taunt with
        a random Hero's name, and teleport the hero to a random room to
        die alone against a Nemesis with adrenaline. There is a short
        delay of 6 seconds between the taunt and the teleport. Recall
        the hero whose name is called out. After Nemesis appears in the
        lab, sprint out of lab to avoid dying. If sprint is not
        available, sufficient tankiness or a Freeze Ray can keep you
        alive long enough to walk out of lab.
    -   After a short Umbrella Ambush, there will be a break where no
        mob will attack, and only Umbrella Commandos will periodically
        spawn. Use this time to visit ABM's if needed.
    -   Bring Nemesis to the Graveyard to trigger the Phase Neutralizer.
        This will remove Nemesis' invulnerability, and allow him to be
        killed. If Nemesis leaves the graveyard, he will Rephase.
        Nemesis is considered to remain in the graveyard if he remains
        on the darker terrain edge along its walls. He can be lead
        outside via 1 of the 2 entrances, and along a wall, so that the
        team can fight him outside of the graveyard and not be
        surrounded by spawning mob.
    -   Nemesis will spawn a nuke, reactivate his Force Field with 500e,
        and give himself Adrenaline, and heal himself (Second Life)
        after being brought down to critical health. Use the Force Field
        Neutralizer again to remove the shield for one last time.
    -   Nemesis will trigger Confusion shortly after being unphased and
        brought down to critical health (8125.0+1875.0\*PlayerCount)
        again (between 30-150 seconds). An Umbrella Ambush combined with
        a color reversal - Umbrellas will have the team's colors, while
        the team will be colored as Umbrellas. The effect will reverse
        after a short period of time. Commandos will no longer spawn
        after this.
    -   Finish Nemesis off. He will continually self Adrenaline, and
        receive Stim/Adrenaline/Pep Talk from reinforcing Umbrella
        Soldiers. Continually use Freeze Ray to remove these buffs.
