[rightDuring](file:tooltip-cpu.jpg "wikilink") boss fights often times
mob is a bigger issue than boss damage. In these cases you will want to
have your CPU back away from the boss and focus on crowd control
instead. CPUs can surge allied heroes and Mecha Mutts when they fall
below 250 energy.

While it is most effective on the CPU given it is a percent based heal,
this can be used to heal any mechanical unit in the game, including
robodogs and minis.

### [Robo-Mod](image:ability-gearmod.gif "wikilink") [Robo-Mod](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tech.htm#GearMod)

[right](file:tooltip-robomod.jpg "wikilink")

**[CPU](CPU "wikilink")**: CPU should be purple modded early game. A
tanking CPU should get an orange mod also. CPU's should have a green mod
by late game. Typically you want all mods on CPU's late game.

**[LAD](Assault_Droid "wikilink")**: LAD's should be green modded when
able, but it doesn't take precedence over anything urgent. Orange and
Purple mods are generally not needed helpful if you have extra cash
laying around. Purple mods are not needed since you can drain energy
from allies and reactors, but help if you plan on using rockets a lot.

**Mecha Mutt:** Purple boards are considered mandatory and a high
priority. Green mod has limited benefit as a mecha's DPS is very low
when tanking. Orange mod specifically **not** recommended as it makes
him less likely to draw mob.

**Kamikaze Canine**: You always want to green mod a Kami as it is a
significant DPS increase. Orange mods depends on other dogs in the game.
With a mecha in the class call, you usually want an Orange mod on the
Kami to reduce draw chances. Purple mod is helpful, but not required.

**Chrome Retriever**: For this dog you don't need any mods, however
Orange mod can help improve his survivability, especially if killing
yellow rads. Purple and Green mods are not worth it.

**[Mini-Droid MkII](Mini-Droid_MkII "wikilink")**: Green mods are
required on these by late game. Purple mods help but are not required
since you can drain energy from allies and reactors. Orange mods are not
required, but help if you have extra cash laying around.

**HO Mini-Droid**: These droids are not usually modded given their
expendability and limited benefit from the mods. Orange mods are not
really worth the money considering the cost for 5 minis per HO. Green
are not really needed since the HO can XLR8, however if you have extras
laying around then they can be used. Purple are not typically needed,
however they help if the droids have high level plasma rounds.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [The Signal](image:ability-signal.gif "wikilink") [The Signal](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tech.htm#signal)

[right](file:tooltip-ova.jpg "wikilink")*If you have a second Techie use
this while the first one is already droids will become "Bloodlusted" and
gain a temporary additional boost of 30% attack speed and 10% move
speed. Note that maintaining the second signal will NOT keep the droids
bloodlusted, and must be deactivated and reactivated continuously to
work.*Â 

A good trick is to trade off on bloodlusts. Person A has The Signal on
and Person B turns his on to achieve the bloodlust. Just after, Person A
stops broadcasting the signal, saving the energy. Once bloodlust wears
off, Person A reactivates to regain bloodlust. Person B shuts his Signal
off. Repeat. This gives the 2x effect of The Signal for only 6.5eps
(overall) per techie.

You can also have both Techies activate their Signal and turn it off
shortly after. This will give all nearby robots bloodlust effect without
having to maintain signal. It is of course less of a buff than
maintaining both, however it is a lot cheaper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Stand Down](image:ability-holster.gif "wikilink") [Stand Down](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-tech.htm#holster)

[right](file:tooltip-standdown.jpg "wikilink")

Stood down tech ops is at the bottom of the aggro table - alongside a
civilian.

Except in the very early game and rare situations most tech ops remain
stood down. This allows for lower nanites in exchange for spending
valuable skill points on other skills.

A stood down techies will never be targeted by a rad bolt as rad bolts
are only cast in response to a hostile action against the unit.

Hyper Beasts will blink on a stood down tech ops in response to a
hostile action by any of its units. These are strong counters to tech
ops and a reason to get some nanites to survive a hit.

If Nemesis chooses to cast an ability on a stood down tech ops, the CPU
will instead be subject to roll. The exception to this is Mind Slay.

## Skill Builds

**Single Tech Ops** For a game with only one Techie, you would probably
be best off getting 16 points into CPU as soon as you can.

-   8 points into Aligned Armor (first), 6 points into Aligned Vitality
    and 2 points into Aligned Energy
-   Max OVA.
-   10-14 levels into nanites for sturdier tech and faster CPU.
-   Remainder into Flamethrower

**Dual Tech Ops**

Because the CPUs auras do not stack, speccing two techies is different
from speccing just one. In a game with two Techies you will typically
want one or both to use skill point builds, such as skilled or reckless.
My preference is one Reckless/skilled, and the other energy based or
packrat.

Techie \#1:

-   8 points into CPU. These points go into Aligned Energy.
-   14 points into nanites.
-   Max OVA with 16 points.
-   8 points into CPU for Aligned Munitions.
-   Remaining points into Flamethrower.

Techie \#2:

-   16 points into CPU for Aligned Armor and Aligned Vitality. Gives
    team an offtank.
-   14 points into nanites.
-   Max OVA.
-   Remaining points into Nanites or Flamethrower as needed. This techie
    is often near mob and splash when repairing his CPU so nanites is
    often better.

In combat, Techie \#2's CPU should be closer to the mob than Techie \#1
CPU, as it will have more armor and hp regen. For a typical boss fight
Techie \#2's CPU will attack the boss and tank as needed, or simply DPS
it. Techie \#1's CPU will hold position away from the boss to keep flame
on any mob that shows up. The only times this may not need to be the
case is if you have a flame Mav or Pyro. Also, if mob isn't very
threatening then both CPU's can attack the boss.

Depending on players skill level will decide which techie uses the LADs.
If one Techie is a packrat and using MK2 mini droids then it isn't
uncommon for the other Techie to the LADs. Also, though the Techie makes
the lads, other players in the team can use them without increasing uber

One player in the group should carry a riot shield if possible, as it
helps not only human tanks, but can be used on a CPU if one needs to
tank.

## Class Builds

A Tech Ops is often played most effectively using either: Engineer,
Gadgeteer, Reckless, Energizer, Skilled, or Packrat, for their trait. A
"techie" as is their common nickname should almost always go robotics
for their spec. How you level him is of course up to you, as different
play styles demand different skills.

For a typical Techie medium armor is usually best. Since the lighter the
armor on the human, the faster the movespeed on the CPU, and the CPU
does not lose any durability due to this. Light armor leaves the Techie
a bit vulnerable, while heavy makes the CPU very slow. However your play
style may require something different.

[link=traits#Reckless](file:trait-reckless.jpg "wikilink") **Reckless**:



*Pros*: Gains 10 bonus skill points to use for skills, which a Techie is
starved for.

*Cons*: Lower nanites, doesn't buff energy or intelligence in any way.

[link=traits#Skilled](file:trait-skilled.jpg "wikilink") **Skilled**:



*Pros*: Boosts skill points by more than Reckless if you max your
nanites. Also, techie needs EARLY skill points.

*Cons*: One point goes into Critical strike which is wasted in most
builds. Does not help with energy regen, or intelligence.

[link=traits#Engineer](file:trait-engineer.jpg "wikilink") **Engineer**:



*Pros*: Allows you to gain a major boost to energy regen, and a minor
boost to intelligence as well.

*Cons*: Doesn't help with skill points. The intelligence is fairly small
early game. Uses up all your inventory.

[link=traits#Gadgeteer](file:trait-gadgeteer.jpg "wikilink")
**Gadgeteer**:



*Pros*: Bonus intelligence, which allows better items and energy regen
items. Can fuse items in a LAD without losing them if the LAD dies. Can
use riot shield on his tanking CPU.

*Cons*: There is not always enough high intelligence items to go around.
Fusing normal items with LAD's is uncommon. Doesn't help with skill
points.

[link=traits#Packrat](file:trait-pack.jpg "wikilink") **Packrat**: The
downside of this build is he doesn't get bonus skill points,
intelligence, or energy regen.



*Pros*: Allows more room for carrying items so regen items can stay out
front. Allows him the bonus of better Mk2 minis. Shorter cooldown on his
locker means easier access to boards for modding robots.

*Cons*: Only marginally helps energy regen. Does not help skill points.

[link=traits#Energizer](file:trait-energizer.jpg "wikilink")
**Energizer**:



*Pros*: Gains a free 33% energy regen and backup battery (roughly 5eps
overall) without losing any inventory.

*Cons*: Has highest potential for energy regen than some other builds
but lack of int or resources makes that hard to achieve. Doesn't help
with intelligence or skill points.

Robotics: When using two Techies its best to start off with one going
minor energy field, and the other going Zephyr field. The energy helps
with filling reactors, and Zephyr gives movespeed which is good for the
slow moving CPU early game, and 10% attack speed helps as well. Later in
the game when energy is no longer an issue you may want to switch Minor
energy field to vulnerability scanner. When using one techie then it
depends on your team, however going minor energy field comes in handy
for the same reasons as above. However, if the CPU seems to be slowing
the team down you should probably switch to Zephyr instead.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Information

<u>Large Assault Droids</u> (LADs)

LADs should ALWAYS be built by a Techie if one is in the group, as it
does not increase Uber in the game. Also the DPS of three MK1 lads far
surpasses that of one MK3 lad in a Techie class call. So use 3 MK1
LAD'ss instead of 1 MK3 LAD.

**LAD \#1**: Typically the first lad should get one point into rockets
and max nanites. Because there are Techies in the class call, there is
no point in wasting a point into Reconstruction. After maxing nanites
you should probably max rockets. By this point in the game you should
hopefully have the second LAD. If by chance you end up with extra skill
points you can dump them into Reconstruction. Do NOT put any points into
OTA on this lad, as the lower level OTA overrides the higher level one.

**LAD \#2**: The second lad is based on the current class call. If no
one is rad resistant, and the radiation level is above 30 you should
probably have this LAD get level 1 rockets, then max Radiation scanner
then Nanites. At this point you should either max rockets on this one as
well (only if you have the third LAD) or start putting points into
Reconstruction. You don't want to max rockets if the third LAD has not
been found, as level 1 rockets are priceless for waking the party after
a radiation sleep. Do NOT put any points into OTA on this lad, as the
lower level OTA overrides the higher level one. After radiation level is
down to 0, if you have time before Nemesis spawn, you may want to
destroy this lad and remake it, without having to waste 8 points into
Radiation scanner.

**LAD \#3**: This final LAD will probably be found mid to late game.
Unlike the other LAD's this one you will want to fuse 5 mentats with
him, for a bonus 5 skill points. Keep in mind the Techie will need 150
intelligence to fuse the mentats. After making him you will want 1 point
into rockets. After that you can put about 10 points into nanites. After
that however all points will go into OTA.

**MK2 mini droids**: MK2 minis as they are called will also depend on
the current class call, for how you use them. Methods for building them
are as such.

-   Packrat Techie: If someone is packrat, then that person can make the
    minis and fuse the remotes with them. This allows the minis to go
    anywhere they want without having to be near their hero to stay in
    range of the remotes signal. Another advantage of this method is it
    allows the minis to integrate circuit boards for additional skill
    points, and if destroyed they will drop the boards again, whereas
    other minis will not.
-   Gadgeteer Techie: A gadgeteer Techie may eventually gain enough
    intelligence to carry a remote and use it. For this method it is
    best to build the mini's you want and keep only one remote in your
    inventory, and locker the others. You can have several mini's
    maintained by one remote this way. Make sure they do not go out of
    range of the signal or they lose energy and become unable to preform
    any actions, even shooting or moving, if they reach 0 energy.
-   Any other Techie: For a techie who is not packrat OR has enough
    intelligence to maintain a remote, there is a third method to
    maintain minis. This method involves fusing one remote with one of
    the LAD's (preferably LAD \#1) and the the lad will maintain the
    Mini Signal instead of the hero. You can then use mentats to boost
    your intelligence temporarily to build more and locker the remotes.
    As long as the mini's stay near the LAD with the other Mini they
    will stay in range of his "Remote". This is the least preferable
    method is unlike the other methods, a LAD's mini droid cannot
    integrate circuit boards. However it does save heroes from being
    forced to carry the remote in their inventories.
-   Note when building minis and having them integrate circuit boards
    you should have the first one max his Neutralize Computer System,
    for use against power armor units such as umbrella soldier,
    commandos, and Nemesis. All mini droids after the first one should
    max their Defensive Matrix. When a Techie builds a mini2, his armor
    aura helps only robots, unlike all other classes. This CPUs to tank
    much more effectively since their tanking is fully based on HP and
    not energy.
-   Late game you should have whoever has the highest weapon skill/ammo
    upgrades make one MK2 mini. After making this mini he should pass it
    off to the designated Mini controller. This will upgrade the weapon
    of his other minis to the same level, since MK2 minis damage is
    based on the weapon skill level of the creator.

## Guides

### Valcrist77's Double Mini2 Build

#### Build:

Reckless/Robotics/Hacking, or

Packrat/Robotics/Hacking, or

Gadgeteer/Robotics/Hacking

#### Notes:

-   Take heavy or medium, depending on your preference for evading
    blinking ghouls and spawning minis via sprint.Set robo-pet to
    Zephyr, or Minor Energy Field if there's a 2nd robo-pet.
-   You can take other specializations if there are 2 other Robotics
    users.
-   The gadgeteer version of this build is basically identical, but you
    can build LADs with the Storage Duo-Cell/Rapid-Reloads/Droid Remote
    without ammo upgrades, then remake them when the ammo upgrades
    become available. You can build 1 Droid Remote normally, then drop
    the Remote in the locker of lab - the LAD remote will be able to
    power the hero built Mini Droid MKII. You can also fuse 2 Droid
    Remotes into 2 LADs, instead of holding one in your hero's
    inventory.
-   You can ditch either Droid Remote if your team is hard up on cash,
    though this is sub-optimal.
-   You can build both Droid Remotes on the Packrat hero, though this is
    sub-optimal due to the lower damage. As compensation, you will be
    able to spend an additional 720g on 6 circuit boards, to skill more
    Robot Armor aura.
-   You can cast Neutralize on Nemesis while he is phased, though you
    must do it manually. Auto-Cast will not work on him during the
    phase.
-   You can hold a great deal of batteries, bandages, revives, and the
    Force-Field Neutralizer in your backpack/locker during Nemesis
    Fight. Keep more critical items in the backpack - you can drop those
    while dead, but you cannot access them from the locker while dead.
-   Zeal-Mag can be a good item in the LAD, but only during the early
    game, or if there is a lack of rapid reloads or other items to be
    fused. Mid- late game, its better to use the standard full builds,
    and leave the Zeal to be sold for 2k, or to be used by a Hero.
-   Chemistry is also good in low mans for guaranteed item LAD
    construction.Really, you can take almost any trait and
    specialization and it will be useful. Hacking is the only mandatory
    part of the build, due to the huge gold demand a robot army imposes.
-   Reckless is the strongest offensive option, due to the rapid
    availability of skill points for OVA at 15-20 minutes into the game,
    which gives your LADs large damage boosts very early in the game.
-   Packrat gives you additional QMing abilities, and a painless circuit
    board source for mods. It will also allow you to use a mini2 without
    putting a remote into the LAD.
-   Gadgeteer gives you the ability to use your own Riot shield, and
    other high int items. Usually mandatory in low man games due to the
    requirement of tanking with the CPU for the entire game, and the
    lack of other Riot users.
-   All other traits can be useful in their own ways, the tech ops has a
    wide variety of useful traits available.
-   Only the CPU (and robodog) is immune to pissing off a Super Mutant.
    LADs and Mini Droid MKIIs can piss it off if given enough damage and
    armor reduction.

#### Skill build:

-   1 point into CPU/OVA/Flame, rest nanites
-   16 CPU points and 10 nanites.
-   16 OVA, then rest into nanites or flamethrower, depending on your
    comfort level on nanites. Nanites are mostly necessary for friendly
    fire/blinking ghouls/nukes, which can be dodged by good micro, but
    don't feel bad about getting more nanites if necessary to stay
    alive.
-   CPU skill point distribution: 5/8/3/0. You can get more vitality
    instead of munitions, but 3 is the practical minimum to keep the
    other robots healthy after invariably tanking some splash and
    Nemesis laser hits.
-   LAD skill point distribution: Max nanites, 1 Concussive Rocket. 2
    LADs should go max Concussive Rocket, while 1 LAD should go max OTA.
    You can dump excess skill points into Reconstruction, though the
    chances of this being used is slim to none, and can be misused.
-   Mini-Droid MKII skill point distribution: For Nemesis fight, put all
    6 skill points into Neutralize, and turn on Auto-Cast or cast it
    yourself on Nemesis. Pre-Nemesis, a player built Mini Droid MKII
    should skill max Robot Armor aura. You can always remake your
    Mini-Droid MKII to change skill point distribution. The LAD built
    Mini Droid MKII should take Neutralize if there is no other Mini,
    otherwise it takes armor.

#### Game Guide:

1.  **Scout towards the middle of the map**: Aim to explore as many
    rooms as possible. *Reach the lab either as soon as possible, or at
    6:00/6:40*. Get your first LAD out of the lab. You can skip this
    step if it was teleported to you by a sniper, but you should still
    short scout if possible due to the value of early rad hunting and
    item discovery, and the Tech Ops' ability to short scout early.
2.  **Build a full LAD as soon as possible**: The first 2 full LADs
    should have 3 ammo upgrades, 1 Rapid-Reload II/III, and 1 Storage
    Duo-Cell. If this is a 4-6 man game then having less ammo upgrades
    or no Storage Duo-Cell is acceptable. 2-4 man games may be forced to
    build a LAD with any of the mentioned items ASAP. Spec these 2 LADs
    with max nanites, and rest into Concussive Rockets.
3.  **Build the full LAD in a safe location**: Good times to build LADs
    are - before first APC, during APCs, or after finishing a Reactor.
    Build it in the middle of back of the group, *skill it to max
    nanites and drain a teammate as fast possible* to minimize it being
    ambushed by a fast mob. Try to backpack or locker items that will go
    into a LAD, since your locker and backpack items are easily
    accessible. The optimal setup will have 3 Storage Duo-Cells, all 3
    Rapid-reload types (1,2,3), 8 ammo upgrades, and 1 Droid Remote.
4.  **Fuse the Droid Remote in LAD \#2 or \#3**: Since the 3rd LAD often
    comes between 40-60 minutes into the game, and your team is unlikely
    to have spare money until then, it is best to put the 1500g Droid
    Remote into the 3rd LAD, and spec that LAD to have only 1 point in
    Concussive Rockets, and the rest into OTA. If no 3rd LAD comes, you
    can just build 1 or 2 Droid Remotes yourself. Alternatively, you can
    fuse the Droid Remote into the 2nd LAD, if the team can spare the
    1500g early enough. It is worthwhile at that point, though the team
    will have to stretch the budget a little. It helps to have partial
    power up for this to work, due to the large amount of gold from
    hacking/selling haz/selling items.
5.  **Build LAD Mini-Droid MKII now or later**: Fusing the Droid Remote
    into the LAD does not increase uber - having the LAD build the
    Mini-Droid MKII via the Z menu will increase uber. You can save
    building the Mini-Droid MKII until late game, or build it ASAP for
    the tor filling power and laser DPS.
6.  **Use Robo-Mods via Locker**: As the game progresses and money
    becomes more available, *you can use your locker to purchase circuit
    boards and teleport them to your hero*, for Robo-Mods. The CPU needs
    2 orange/ 2 purple boards. Each LAD and Mini-Droid MKII needs 2
    green/ 2 purple boards. Each player built Mini-Droid MKII needs 6
    extra circuit boards for integration, which should be some
    combination of purple/green boards - I recommend 6 purple boards for
    a newer player, while 6 green boards can work out well for an
    experienced player. This is a total of 2 orange/ 12 purple/ 16 green
    boards, or 3600g. You can also add 2 green boards to the CPU for
    some nice extra DPS, and 2 orange boards on each Mini-Droid MKII,
    and then 2 orange boards on each LAD, for another 2 green/ 10 orange
    boards, or 1440g.
7.  **Consume ammo upgrades with CPU**: This is the next best usage of
    ammo upgrades after the LADs, due to the high bonus damage and
    attack speed the CPU can receive.
8.  **(Re)Build LAD Mini-Droid MKII last**: After building the
    Mini-Droid MKII via your Packrat hero, you should make sure to
    build/re-build the LAD Mini-Droid MKII. This will give all
    Mini-Droid MKII's under your control the higher laser damage skill
    via the LAD formula, instead of via the hero formula. The LAD
    formula often gives near maximum damage, while the hero formula
    requires high levels of Critical Strike and Flamethrower skill,
    which is a sub-optimal build in this case. *You can rebuild any
    Mini-Droid MKII at no penalty* - only non-packrat heroes cannot
    destroy them and have them drop integrated circuit boards. Robo-Mod
    circuit boards always drop.
9.  **You can remake your Mini-Droid MKII's** to benefit from increased
    Hero/LAD level. A good time during Nemesis fight is after the
    Know-Your-Name phase Umbrella Ambush. *Make sure to build the LAD
    Mini-Droid MKII last to get the higher laser damage skill.*

#### Cost Analysis:

A properly built robot army will be the most expensive asset the team
owns:

LAD \#1: 2000g (often 1.25k avg due to hacking for Recall 1)

--- Duo-Cell (250g), Rapid-Reload III (250g), 3 ammo upgrades (300g)

LAD \#2: 1000g

--- Duo-Cell (250g), Rapid-Reload II (250g), 3 ammo upgrades (300g)

LAD \#3: 500g

--- Duo-Cell (250g), Rapid-Reload I (250g), 2 ammo upgrades (200g),
Droid Remote

Mini-Droid MKII 1 (1500g)

Mini-Droid MKII 2 (1500g)

-- 6 purple/green boards (720g)

Necessary Robo-Mod boards: 2 orange/ 12 purple (1680g)

Optional Robo-Mod boards: 12 green/ 10 orange (2640g)

Ammo Upgrades on the CPU: 1-3 ammo upgrades (100-300g)

**Total cost**:11300g - 14140g

#### Numerical Analysis:

Possible Attack Speed Boosts in a reasonable game:

135% from Rapid Reload I-III

150% from Level 24 Blitz triple stack, adjacency

2-26% from natural LAD agi (level 40 for 13 agi)

33% from Signal

33% from Signal Stim

10% from Zephyr

20% from 2 green Robo-mods

0-25% from OTA (level 14: is Max Nanites, level 15: first point in
Rockets, level 16: first point in OTA, level 40: 25 points in OTA)

432 Total

Possible Attack Damage Boosts:

56% from Level 16 OVA. Stacks twice.

24% from Level 8 Munitions. Does not stack.
