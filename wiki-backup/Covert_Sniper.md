## Trainable Abilities

### [Concussion Grenade](image:ability-conc.gif "wikilink") [Concussion Grenade](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#Concussion)

[right](file:Covert_Sniper_-_Improve_Concussion_Grenade.jpg "wikilink")

> At Level 8, Concussion Grenade gains the ability to stun normal units
> (not bosses) for a short period of time, and from that point on
> becomes extremely useful at halting the mob in its tracks. The stun
> will reveal invisible units making it useful to kill blue zombies on
> extinction. Although the duration is heavily reduced on
> [bosses](bosses "wikilink"), this ability makes bosses significantly
> less threatening to the tank.

> Concussion Grenades are useful for slowing priority targets (such as
> [TNT](EnemyUnits "wikilink")) when near the team. It causes no damage,
> but allows other players the chance to move away before the target is
> killed. While you should be careful about using this ability around
> your teammates, it does have a reduced duration on heros (and likewise
> bosses). It doesn't stun allies, but they have a [broken
> ankle](conditions#ankle "wikilink") or are
> [toxined](conditions "wikilink"), this maybe be enough to reduce their
> [movespeed](move_speed "wikilink") to 1.

> At high levels, the duration of this skill on bosses is sufficient to
> keep them near permanently under the effects. This provides an
> immensely energy efficient form of crowd control while at the same
> time saving the tank from a lot of damage. Because tanks are rarely
> dealing much damage with their gun, hitting them with concussion
> grenade will make little difference. Especially if there is a lot of
> mob on the tank, don't hesitate to use those so it hits the boss, the
> tank and everything around them. Because the range is rather short,
> using this skill on bosses negates most of the attack range bonus from
> marksmanship. You need to get close and shoot so running back away
> just wastes time. keep this in mind when making a skill build.

### [link=<http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#aim>](file:ability-aim.gif "wikilink") [Aim](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#aim)

[right](file:Covert_Sniper_-_Improve_Aim.jpg "wikilink")

> This skill should be leveled until the percentage of active time
> (duration divided by duration plus cooldown) is high enough that the
> sniper can control the priority targets that approach the group.
> Points past 8 primarily reduce the attack speed loss that results from
> Aim. This skill proves extremely useful for taking down
> [bosses](bosses "wikilink") due to its guaranteed critical, but is
> usually paired with [Confidence](Psychologist#Confidence "wikilink"),
> [Adrenaline](Medic#Adren "wikilink"), or a [stim
> pack](Items#toc3 "wikilink") to counter the loss of attack speed. Make
> sure that you are in a safe position when using this skill, since the
> [move speed](move_speed "wikilink") loss from this skill makes it
> harder to run away.

> Although it used to in the past, Aim no longer interacts with the
> chance to pierce granted by Marksmanship.

### [Marksmanship](file:ability-marks.gif "wikilink") [Marksmanship](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#marks)

[right](file:Covert_Sniper_-_Improve_Marksman.jpg "wikilink")

> A notable bonus of this ability it the increased
> [sight](sight "wikilink") radius that it grants, decreasing the need
> for more cameras. Increased attack range also allows for you to remain
> further away from the mob while taking down enemies, and thus less
> vulnerable. The range also allows a sniper to pick out priority from
> further away, eliminating threats before they reach the group.

> When fighting [commandos](Bosses#commandos "wikilink"), the sniper can
> do significant damage while remaining out of their range. If the
> sniper does kill a commando, this gives him additional time to run
> before the revenge AI can target and kill him.

> Marksmanship grants a chance to the snipers shots to pierce a killed
> unit and strike a unit behind it. The damage dealt to the next unit is
> determined by the Sniper damage, taking into account modifier's like
> ammo, Pep-Talk, Dragoon etc. This is damage has a chance to be
> multiplied by the Sniper's level of Critical Strike. Aim is irrelevant
> for both the chance to crit and the multiplier. The final damage is
> dealt to the unit. If that damage is sufficient to kill the unit,
> there is a chance that the bullet will proceed to the next unit,
> repeating this process until either the bullet misses the chance to
> pierce, there is no unit in range behind a dying unit, or the unit
> that gets hit by the bullet does not die.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Critical Strike](file:ability-crit.gif "wikilink") [Critical Strike](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#crit)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Critical_Strike.jpg "wikilink")

> Putting levels into critical shot allows the Sniper to better achieve
> his role of priority targeting and taking down dangerous mobs, which
> is of great help to the group. High levels of critical shot can
> produce enough damage to 'piss off' [Super
> Mutants](bosses#toc5 "wikilink"). To avoid this, utilize the Sniper's
> innate skill.



----

### [Nanites](image:ability-nanites.gif "wikilink") [Nanites](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#nanites)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

> Although snipers are not expected to tank and rarely need to take many
> hits, they should not neglect nanites. Snipers are as likely to get
> hit as any non-tank and for this reason they should make sure to have
> a healthy amount of points invested into nanites, though not
> necessarily have them maxed. That said, any points you don't put into
> nanites can be placed into other more offenseive skills for a higher
> risk playstyle.

## Innate Abilities

### [Item Teleport](image:ability-itd.gif "wikilink") [Item Teleport](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#itd)

[right](file:Sniper_ITD.jpg "wikilink")

> This skill is very useful for retrieving Antidotes from the lab,
> Batteries from ABMs, storing items in visible spaces like the lab or
> reactors, passing Recall between the group and a scout, and recovering
> Top Secret items from the lab.





----

### [Surveillance Camera](image:ability-camera.gif "wikilink") [Construct Camera](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#camera)

[right](file:Construct_Camera.jpg "wikilink")

> Cameras are very useful for finding targets for infinite ranged
> skills, and for seeing the mob's location and direction. Intersections
> are frequently good locations for this. When scouting, try to lay
> Cameras in rad rooms and item rooms to keep track of rad spawns and
> items to teleport. If possible, placing the Camera in a corner instead
> of right in the doorway will ensure that it lasts longer. Although
> cameras are invisible, [dogs](Dog "wikilink") are still capable of
> spotting them for the rest of the mob. Place your cameras off of walls
> and mob pathing points to increase their survivability.

> When camming for group visibility (near the group), be sure to place
> cameras slightly away from the group to provide maximum visibilty, and
> in a spot where they will not be splashed and subsequently destroyed,
> such as on the opposite side of the road that the mob is coming from.
> A Sniper should cam the path the group follows as well as ahead of the
> group. While camping, laying a cam from the direction of the mob will
> significantly increase the safety of the party. Laying a cam at tors
> decreases death chance.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Sneak](image:ability-hide.gif "wikilink") [Sneak](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-sniper.htm#hide)

[right](file:Sniper_Sneak.jpg "wikilink")

> Casting an ability while sneaking acts as a short-duration pheromones.
> This can be useful to pull aggro off of someone. Conversely, it can
> result in undesirable aggro.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Information

-   ITD is useful at manipulating items for the group
    -   if your team has the ability to do so, try to ITD the lab LAD to
        the party
    -   A great way to store items that your team currently isn't using
        is to place them in the lab, a tor, or an abm so they can be
        ITDed when needed.
    -   When you visit the lab, try to buy lots of dotes and drop them
        on the ground so that they can later be ITDed when needed.
-   Cloak
    -   Stay cloaked as much as possible when reconning.
    -   If you get Spiders Sprint.
    -   Dogs, Spiders, Tyrants, and Bosses can and will detect you -
        beware of / kill them.
-   Mark ABMs and Check Tors.
-   Mark means to enter them so they become globally visible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hints/Tips

When soloing, carrying Batteries is a good idea. Being uncloaked during
spider spawn will always get you webbed. Spiders may appear when you
enter a room. If you must go into a room it is best to go in a corner
and wait for \~5 secs to see if spiders spawn. If you find an item room,
stay along the edge of the room, and place a cam in the far corner. Then
covertly open the crates, locker and pick up what you can, and get out.
Spiders can also be avoided with sprint as well. Sprint gives 100%
evasion. Just make sure not to interrupt it.

### Guides

*Player submitted ways on how to play the class effectively*

Valcrist77's Group Sniper

If medic or psychologist with good stims: Dragoon/Weaponry/Tinkering,
Dragoon/Espionage/Tinkering, Medium Armor

If no medic: Flower Child/Chemistry/Tinkering, Medium Armor

-   Start 1/1/1/1, all skills are useful
-   8 conc for early stun, to save yourself while short scouting, or
    save the group from damage
-   3 crit if no other boss DPS incase of Super Mutant, otherwise 8 crit
-   6/14 nanites are breakpoints for early and mid game
-   16 conc and 8 aim
-   Dump excess points into marksmanship, nanites, or aim

1.  Teleport LAD to group
2.  Short scout for the first 9-20 minutes, depending on group's ability
    to handle priorities.
3.  Teleport MFGs to yourself, then other useful items to group in order
    of priority.
4.  Teleport dotes to group whenever they need them.
5.  Use concussive grenade to save the tank/group from tanking hits, to
    reveal invisible units, and to delay any dangerous priority units.
6.  Use concussive grenade on Nemesis to reduce his DPS
7.  Use Aim in conjunction with the medic's adrenaline to kill bosses,
    and put down mob. Level 1 aim is only 29 seconds longer CD than the
    60 second adrenaline timing, and aim at level 4 can basically keep
    up with medic's uptime on adrenaline. Your gun is usually more
    effective than any other gun for Adrenaline in almost all cases,
    including medium mob control. Rocket Launcher only becomes better
    when the mob is heavily funneled and properly aimed.
8.  Teleport batteries and bandages to players that need them, and try
    to do it as soon as possible. Announce that you are teleporting
    critical items if they don't request it beforehand. Keep an eye on
    the healer/tanks inventory during tense situations, and Nemesis
    fight.
9.  An efficient group will not over-rely on the snipers teleport - try
    to have them group recall for items in lab/using the ABM, so that
    you can keep your ITD counter lower. But don't be afraid to sell
    items when ABM access is not convenient, and to clean up the lab
    whenever you have spare energy.
10. Nemesis will give you a wider berth according to how much
    marksmanship you have (900 units + 40\*marksman level). Use this to
    your advantage to stand apart from the group and avoid
    stuns/targeted attacking when attacking Nemesis, though do still
    mind the presence of other enemies.
11. Use concussive grenade when Nemesis is buffed, or on buffed Umbrella
    Commandos/Soldiers.

**Amoeba's guide**

<u>Build Skill Points</u> Early Game: (8/1/1/0) Late Game:
(8/8-16/8-12/x) x = excess skill points

<u>Build Summary</u> Put one point in crit, aim, and conc out of the
bunker. Then get Crit to level 8 and Nanites between 8-17. Then get 8
Conc. Then get 8 Aim. Finally put any remaining into Aim, Conc, and
Nanites.

If you are a Solo Sniper, get one point in conc out of the bunker. your
first priority will be to max Nanites. After nanites are maxed i like to
get many points in marksman. After marksman is high enough, i like to
get 1 point in crit and max aim.

<u>Skill Information</u> Conc: Conc always costs 80 energy no matter
what level it is. After level 8 conc gains stun. Aim: The first 8 levels
decrease Aim's cooldown greatly (8 seconds per level). The last 8 levels
reduce the attack speed penalty greatly and cooldown slightly (1 second
per level). Marksman: Good for attacking far away power armor units. It
requires a few points before it will be very effective. Also pierces
zombies.

<u>Responsibilities</u> Teleport - TP the Assault Droid Parts out of the
bunker. Pay attention to chat for Teleport and Telepawn requests. Put
any exo suit pieces or items we leave behind in lab. Move for batts and
revives from ABMs to the LAB. Keep the Lab organized. Priority - TNT are
the most important priority. Sneak - Turn Sneak on when you leave the
group, when SM reaches 40%, when you have low hp/energy. Aim - If you
have low level aim you have to ration Aim for boss fights. Cams - Very
important to leave a good trail of cams for the Psychologist, demo, and
leader. Cam around tors. Cam items. Also, when camming rooms, put the
cam in the far corner or a dog will eat it. Scout - Buy batteries from
nearby ABMs, check nearby rooms. Don't go too far and use your cam trail
to determine when the group will need you back. Conc - If you have level
8 or higher conc you can stun commies for the WM so he can x-nade them.
Try to conc exploding things and tommies before you kill them. Note:
Telepawn is more effective than Auction.

<u>Mini-Bosses</u> Commies - Do not kill commies!! Spread your damage
evenly among them. Using high level Conc on commies greatly reduces
their damage output. Also, if your conc is level 8 use it on commies so
the WM can x-nade them. Charred Mutant: Do not shoot Char unless you
plan on kiting or tanking. Blue Dog: Kill blue dogs ASAP. Conc if you
can. SGarg: Stop shooting SGarg when it is critical so it can be frozen
or microwaved. STNT: Do not pop until it is rotted or being kited. Conc
if you can. in the nem fight, you may have to pop it on the borg. Rad
Zombie: You can avoid Rad Bolts with sneak. Atomic Zombie: Only attempt
to kill if you have maxed attack speed, maxed crit, and active aim. If
the tommy is not frozen you may not be able to kill it. You can spam any
level concussion grenade to keep it in place. The nuke will hit you if
you are spamming conc.

<u>Bosses</u> Abom: You should take it down very quickly unless you want
to reposition it for Fumes. Abomb: Try not to pop it on your tank unless
he force fields. Sometimes you can conc it to help kite before the pop.
Super Mutant: Shoot the Super Mutant down to 35% hp. Pick out priority
while your team finishes the SM. using conc sometimes lets off a shot
that can anger the SM. Horror: Rad gargs go down first. Sleep activates
at 35%. You can avoid Rad Bolts with sneak. Zilla: You won't have any
energy so don't take any hits. Try to take it down as quickly as
possible. Note: TNTs are always higher priorities than bosses.
