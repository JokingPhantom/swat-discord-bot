are a very powerful offensive melee unit and should be taken down
quickly not only because of their powerful melee attack, but also
because on death they spawn more units to attack heroes. //Beastlings//
spawn from a dead Beast depending on the mana at death, around one
Beastling for every 12 essence. For this reason, move away from beast
corpses, because the team will auto-target the beastlings and splash
you.

Using mana, the Beast teleports a short distance to strike at the team.
This allows him easier access to the team by approaching more quickly
and skipping the zombies blocking his path. It will often target the
weakest unit or the one attacking it. This skill cost 25 mana for
non-Hyper Ghouls, Hyper Ghouls do not require mana to teleport.

Beasts// carry a TNT barrel and glow a dark black color. When killed the
beast explodes dealing 300/600 damage to nearby allied and enemy units
that goes through nanites. Beastlings do not spawn from a beast that
exploded. These are extremely dangerous because of Blink: they can
teleport into the team and often kill several people if the team doesn't
react quickly enough.

Beasts// have glowing green poison fumes and will drop a poisonous rat
on death. These beasts are adept at striking the team quickly by
blinking and slowing their movement as they run away. The poison rats
and beastling spawns are reason enough to kill this unit before he has a
chance to hit the group.

Beasts// glow green and carry a Radiation Fragment. They add one to the
rad count. The beast gains essence exceptionally fast and a bonus +10
armor. It can use the Rad Bolt ability to cause range damage and then
quickly teleport in for the kill. These are often hard to kill when they
start perma healing. The Rad Fragment they carry gives them 300 mana and
since Beastling spawns are affected by the mana a Ghoul has upon death
Rad Ghouls spawn more Beastlings.

Beasts// do not look any different and can sometimes assume another form
as well, such has the deadly Hyper Double-TNT Beast. It will have no
cooldown on Blink and in addition to 50 extra armor. Hyper ghouls blink
fast and often and can be devastating even to spaced out groups.

## Notes

Beasts are colloquially referred to as ghouls because of their model
type. //How to effectively Kill Beasts and their various forms.// All
beasts are high priority targets and should be focused by snipers and
watchmen. They should be the main target of mind slay and freeze ray as
both prevent blink and beastling spawn. DTNT Hyper Beasts can easily be
more deadly than any miniboss. They are sometimes able to blink before
gun damage can get to them, making them explode right after they get
next to someone. Going through a blink cancels any long-term effect of
phero, allowing him to jump around the group again. They can blink
faster than a grenade can land and are attracted by the attack command
faster than a gun can go off. Freeze or mind slay early. Microwave is
the only other instant-damage skill, but should be used with caution.
