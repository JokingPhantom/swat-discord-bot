*Super Mutants (SM)* have the highest health of any boss, but minimal
armor. He often play favorites with people he likes to attack so it is a
very good idea to have someone attack then drag him after them while the
rest of the team fills his body with a heavy dosage of lead. This boss
benefits from the same radiation bracket based buffs as regular
[mutants](Mutant "wikilink") and upon death awards 3 valor points to
each hero until the valor pool is depleted.

## Skills

-   Phase: The Super Mutant turns black periodically, during which time
    they are completely invulnerable to attacks and untargetable. Only
    available on Survival, Nightmare, and Extinction Super Mutants.

<!-- -->

-   Piss Off: If the Super Mutant is dealt more than 1000 damage
    (including armor) while he has less than 1/3 his health, he will
    become "pissed off" and momentarily gain 99% evasion and a massive
    armor boost as well as regenerating a large chunk of his health.

<!-- -->

-   Super Smash: Causes heavy damage and a lengthy stun. In higher
    difficulties, Super Mutants have a chance for a reduced cooldown on
    Super Smash, allowing them to stun more than one unit at a time.
    This is a casted skill and thus effects units while sprinting.

<!-- -->

-   Concussive Pound: Disables all the effected hero's abilities
    including the ability to shoot. Be very careful with this ability
    because if the attack also gives the tank a head injury and he loses
    the intelligence for his Shield Capacitor, his nanites will glitch
    and he won't be able to turn them back on with his abilities
    disabled. To prevent this, give the hero a mentat before the SM gets
    to him, or get the hero 128 intelligence via valor points before you
    fight an SM. This ability is only active during Nightmare and
    Extinction.

<!-- -->

-   Tremor: All large bosses do not attack C4 and Claymores, but their
    heavy footsteps do damage to nearby C4 and Claymores.

<!-- -->

-   True Sight: All bosses have truesight in a large radius.

==<Notes:==>

-   Super Mutants always attempt to Super Smash the first unit to deal
    damage it. Note that [Cluster Rockets](Cyborg#cluster "wikilink")
    and [Concussion Rockets](LAD#concussion "wikilink") are cast from
    neutral units and don't count for this. The Super Mutant will then
    ignore all other units until that unit is smashed or far out of
    range. In higher difficulties, Super Mutants have a chance for a
    reduced cooldown on Super Smash, allowing them to stun more than one
    unit at a time. Super Smash on mini droids will always give a
    reduced cooldown on smash.

<!-- -->

-   Because Super Smash is a spell it does not spend attack cooldown.
    Super Smash is almost always followed immediately by the SM's strong
    attack. If you can't take both hits, don't volunteer for absorbing
    the smash.

<!-- -->

-   Because [Snipers](Sniper "wikilink") will often have [Critical
    Strike](Sniper#crit "wikilink") leveled high enough to piss off the
    SM, it is best to have all sniper rifles stop shooting the boss once
    the SM is under 33\~50% hp, depending on difficulty. The easiest way
    to do this is either [Sneak](Sniper#sneak "wikilink") or issue
    simple right-click orders on the ground to keep your player walking.
    Before the SM arrives attack a few things around to see if your
    normal (non-aimed) crits are low enough to not piss off the SM.

<!-- -->

-   The SM's Piss Off ability to incapacitate the team's best boss
    killer is what really makes the SM annoying. Though snipers should
    do their half of the boss damage quickly, the remaining damage will
    be the big problem. Lasers, low-level sniper rifles, reprogrammed
    kamikazi canine, and XLR8'd HOs with minis will be your best boss
    dps options without pissing off the SM.

<!-- -->

-   Be careful! Watchmen with 3 ammo, max laser, and max prodigy
    strategen can do 999 damage per shot. However, adding pep talk or
    enough armor debuffs can make them do too much damage. Magnum,
    masamune, dragoon, and weaponry can put them over the top. Lethality
    specced x-grenades and enemy double TNTs can piss off an SM. Know
    your damage and whether you can attack or not.

<!-- -->

-   Reprogram Kamikazi canine to have max crit, robots cannot piss off
    SMs.

<!-- -->

-   The Piss Off duration is directly related to how damaging the
    triggering shot was, as well as how unhealthy the SM was at the time
    of attack. A sniper with a magnum can piss off the SM long enough
    for it to regain over half its health. Mind Slay and Ion can piss
    off an SM, but do not cause as much duration as normal attacks with
    that much damage.

<!-- -->

-   Super Smash is an ability based off of the Storm Bolt ability, but
    deals more damage than a regular attack from the Super Mutant. Super
    Smash will //always// attempt to lay a stun on the first person that
    the Super Mutant is trying to attack. This means that whoever takes
    the first hit from the SM will //always// be stunned. However, once
    the SM has stunned an enemy, its AI then looks for another target.
    So if another target is within its percieved threat range (ie: its
    target acquisition range), it will not attack a "neutralized"
    (stunned) target again, and will instead pursue a more threatening
    target. This also applies to regular enemies, as they will usually
    ignore the stunned officer in exchange for one that poses more of a
    threat.

<!-- -->

-   [Cyborgs](Cyborg "wikilink") with [Force
    Field](Cyborg#ff "wikilink") on will take the stun from Super Smash
    but no damage.

<!-- -->

-   Once the Super Smash ability has been used, the SM won't be able to
    use it again after a period of time, as the skill cools down. Higher
    difficulties give a larger chance for the shorter cooldown, and the
    ability also upgrades in damage and stun time based on how
    uber/player count/difficulty.

<!-- -->

-   Phase is not like the zombie version at all. Super Mutant phase
    turns the SM black (but still visible) and makes it untargettable.
    It is immune to all damage and very difficult to attract by the
    rules of aggro. He uses this ability randomly, making it hard to ion
    or use other strong skills against him. The SM will usually remain
    phased for about 1/3 to 1/2 of the time.

<!-- -->

-   Because Super Mutants are affected by the same rad brackets as
    mutants, an SM / Horror combination can make for a deadly boss
    fight. Snipers should do what damage they can to the SM before
    turning their full attention to the Horror. The team should continue
    to destroy the SM as much as they can, as the sniper should be able
    to finish off the Horror without assistance.

## Hint/Tips

*Handling the arrival of a Super Mutant*

-   Super Mutants will be tracked via satellite once 3 reactors have
    been powered all all difficulties below Extinction. An announcement
    with minimap ping will always warn you when a boss spawns, but the
    same announcement is made for all large bosses.

<!-- -->

-   If you see an SM coming you should intentionally choose who he is
    going to stun. Pick someone who can survive the blast and is not
    critical to the boss fight. Usually a psychologist or tactician
    volunteers for this job, but if mob is already well controlled a
    demo might step up. Try to not let the medic, tank, or sniper take
    the initial hit so that they can do their part for the boss fight.

<!-- -->

-   Cyborgs should realize that pheromones can be released (not
    recharged) even while stunned. If you get stunned halfway through
    this boss fight you can still do something to keep the team safe.

<!-- -->

-   By Cambrioleuse: It is very intelligent to take an SM in an alley
    because the gun that will most likely attack the SM first is a
    sniper or other non-tanking unit. In order for the SM to smash the
    sniper he must go through the tank (which he cannot) so the SM will
    spend some time trying to run through the tank while you can shoot
    the SM. However, this doesn't last forever and eventually he will
    smash the tank. Of course now he still cannot run through the tank
    so the tank is able to take the super smash and tank with this
    method.

<!-- -->

-   You should not take the SM in an alley if you are relying on a
    splash weapon to finish off the boss. Like aforementioned an XLR8'd
    HO with 5 minis can do a lot for the second half of the SM fight.
    However, if you use the alley method your main tank would get
    splashed to death in moments by a full-speed HO. Choose your
    battleground depending on your team composition.

<!-- -->

-   You should also never stand right behind your tank if using the
    alley method. SMs have a pretty good reach and might reach right
    over your tank to hit you if he wants. And Super Smash and
    Concussive Pound are AoE abilities and you will probably be effected
    by it if you hug the tank.
