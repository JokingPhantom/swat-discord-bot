For statistics on the [Umbrella
Clone](http://redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm) see the main
SWAT page.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Trainable Abilities

### [Firestorm](image:ability-flare.gif "wikilink") [Firestorm](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#fstorm)

[rightFire](file:tooltip-firestorm.jpg "wikilink") Storm is useful for
destroying innards or massive amounts of mob if you position correctly.
Highly leveled it can destroy mob, though you can "burn through" mana
quickly if spammed excessively. Firestorm is the only AoE damage that
does not hurt allies, so it is useful for clearing civs and when being
ambushed while moving. Combined with Spacial Warp or other abilities
that compress the mob, Fire Storm can be utterly devastating.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Viral Infusion](file:ability-vinf.png "wikilink") [Viral Infusion](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#vinf)

[rightViral](file:tooltip-viral.jpg "wikilink") Infusion heals allies
over time and increases their movement speed, all from a range. Although
its relatively long cooldown and slow healing make it difficult for the
Umbrella Clone to be the primary healer, but she can very effectively
add to the healing of a team. The speed boost of viral infusion alone
can prevent or help recover from potentially disastrous situations.



----

### [Spatial Warp](file:ability-warp.png "wikilink") [Spatial Warp](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#warp)

[rightSpacial](file:tooltip-spatialwarp.jpg "wikilink") Warp creates a
slowing field around the main hero. This field gets stronger as enemies
get closer. This can prevent Alice from taking damage and pairs well
with her melee mode attacking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Dual Wield](file:ability-dual.png "wikilink") [Dual Wield](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#refrif)

[rightThe](file:tooltip-ucweapons.jpg "wikilink") two-shot Dual Wield of
Alice's main gun provides excellent cover fire. It can be compared to
the Watchman's Gatling Laser in dps and function, while having a few
distinct differences. Dual-Wielding can damage a boss while still
assisting in clearing mob, or focus a priority target while maintaining
the second shot on the nearest foe. It can also be used for aggro drops
while firing, such as shooting a rad and using the second shot to keep
damage being dealt on the mob. However, care should be taken when tnts
have made it into the group -- the second shot of dual wield cannot be
directly controlled and can inadvertently detonate tnts.

Skill points spent in weapon skills are also automatically applied to
Alice's Clone.

Blast Amplifiers are the heavy damage melee mode for which Alice is
known. Her single-target damage output is significantly increased, and
cleave can make this damage even greater. Blast Amplifiers are
especially useful against innards, clustered Commies, and sludge
tentacles. Keeping her copy back in ranged mode can provide cover fire,
or putting both into melee mode can be used to devastating effect.
Beware of tnts while in melee mode and remember that gargs cannot be
directly attacked with your fists.

Skill points spent in weapon skills are also automatically applied to
Alice's Clone.

### [Nanites](image:ability-nanites.gif "wikilink") [Nanites](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#nanites)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

Nanites are especially important on an Alice that wants to effectively
use Melee mode, as high levels of heavy nanites will allow Alice to stay
in the fight more and deal significantly more damage throughout the
game.

Skill points spent in nanites are also applied to Alice's Clone, and
will take effect when the Clone refreshes nanites.

## Innate Abilities

### [Shockwave](image:ability-swave.png "wikilink") [Shockwave](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#swave)

[rightShockwave](file:tooltip-shockwave.jpg "wikilink") is Alice's big
power play, similar to Tactician's Ion Strike. It can be used to destroy
a huge line of incoming mob and is especially effective when fired down
an alley. Shockwave can also be used to damage or destroy priority
targets, but is very difficult to use against a moving target. Umbs and
Commies should be lined up and be destroyed with impunity. Bosses
similarly will notice their health drop to the massive damage of a
shockwave that also clears out the mob behind them.

Shockwave is a long, thin triangle starting from Alice. Targets at very
close range are extremely difficult to hit, while targets far away will
be hit easily. Shockwave cannot hurt flying units.
----

### [Kinetic Shield](image:ability-kinsh.png "wikilink") [Kinetic Shield](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#kinsh)

[rightKinetic](file:tooltip-kineticshield.jpg "wikilink") Shield is a
temporary force field that can be applied to any hero except yourself.
This ability alone, combined with the trust and coordination of a good
team, can save the entire team from potentially disastrous situations.
Shielding from a few boss hits, a tnt loose in the group, or protecting
an ally running low on energy can be the difference between life and
death.

Exploding Abombs should always be tanked using Kinetic Shield. This
prevents the boss from potentially running loose in the group and saves
the borg's forcefield efficiency for the more prolonged emergencies. If
the tank still has residual energy from a previous shielding, the Alice
should make sure the tank knows to not expect protection from the
explosion.

If a tnt hyper ghoul or other potential danger is loose in the group,
the Alice should use the clone as bait, then protect the clone with
Kinetic Shield. This method both keeps the aggro of the target and
prevents the damage while requiring almost no coordination from the
group.
----

### [Replicate Clone](image:ability-rclone.png "wikilink") [Replicate Clone](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#rclone)

[rightMaintaining](file:tooltip-replicate.jpg "wikilink") a Clone is one
of the most important aspects of playing Alice, as important as a
robodog is to a Maverick. The clone provides security, a second mana
pool, and twice as much gun damage.

If your main hero dies, your clone will become your main hero,
immediately receiving all items, abilities, and skill points from the
main hero.

If either hero dies, you will have to wait 60 seconds before recreating
your clone. Getting your clone back up should be a very high priority.

Only when both your clone and your main hero dies are you ever actually
dead. This is an important safety net when melee fighting, soloing, or
playing Alice in general.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Reactive Instincts](image:ability-reactin.png "wikilink") [Reactive Instincts](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-umbclone.htm#reactin)

[rightAlice](file:tooltipe-reactiveinstincts.jpg "wikilink") is immune
to nearly all types of splash and Area of Effect damage. This allows her
to melee fight without being destroyed by her own teammates.

Alice is still vulnerable to nuke, ion, tnts, and Abombs. Alice is
immune to MIRV explosions but does take damage from the napalm.

Reactive instincts can disable the nanites of umbrella soldiers for a
very brief time. When you see their health drop suddenly and
unexpectedly, you should use that opportunity to finish them off. A
well-timed Shockwave or using your melee cleave can very quickly finish
off Umbrella armies.

## Good Builds

*Alice can be built in multiple ways in both Trait/Spec and skill
build.*

-   <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">In order to destroy
    mob with melee mode, Gifted, Acrobat, Survivalist, Cybernetics,
    Weaponry, and Toughness are useful, while spending skill points
    primarily on your weapon skill and nanites with strong spacial
    warp.</span>
-   <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">For general mob
    killing in both melee and ranged modes, Flower Child, Chem Reliant,
    Chemistry, Prowler, and Weaponry are useful. Spend skill points on
    weapon quickly and you can choose which other skill(s) to use for
    support, depending on the team's composition.</span>
-   <span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.5;">For maximum
    firestorm, Energizer and Engineer can be used for extra mana while
    additional points into Spacial Warp can compress the mob and prepare
    it for roasting.</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">For high support and healing, Swift
    Learner, Skilled, and Reckless can be used to provide the skill
    points to heal and continue on to specialize in any of the Umbrella
    Clone's skills according to the needs of the team.</span>
-   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Engineer Chemistry is my current
    favorite build, as chemistry allows for enhanced use of Regular Stim
    Packs, copying an mfg provides the energy
    </span>necessary<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> to refill stims and
    combining a Combat Vest 1 and a Rapid Reload 1 provide protection
    and damage.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More Information

Spacial Warp stacks with Temporal Distortion (from Watchman nade or
Chrono item), Molotov, Rot, and Freeze. Having a watchman with
distortion grenade provide slowing support can increase your melee
survivability. Molotov is not quite as useful in conjunction because it
also affects the Umbrella Clone, slowing her from reaching her targets.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hints/Tips

Melee mode has a much higher damage output, but requires you to be more
vulnerable to enemy melee attacks. Knowing when to switch between your
two weapon types is key to mastering Alice.

### Guides

**Crowd Control**

The recommended way to play Group Alice.

Suggested Traits: Chem Reliant, Gadgeteer, Energizer

Heavy Armor

Suggested Specs: Chemistry, Cybernetics

Suggested Talent: Wiring, Toughness

-   1 Point in everything
-   Alternate between Gun Skill, Nanites, and Spatial Warp until max
    gun.
-   Get to 10 effective Nanites.
-   Max Spatial Warp.
-   Get to 14 or 19 Nanites, or get more Firestorm as needed to improve
    crowd control. Innards do not spawn during nemesis, but firestorm is
    necessary for CC for high mob/ graveyard fight.

**Solo**

Suggested Traits: Anything works. Packrat, Rad Resistant, Gadgeteer,
Energizer, Gifted are recommended to start to give you extra solo power
and Nem Fight utility.

Spec: Espionage

Light Armor

-   1 Point in everything (skip Viral if you want)
-   Alternate between Gun Skill and Nanites until max gun.
-   Get to 10 effective Nanites.
-   Max Spatial Warp
-   Viral, Firestorm, or Nanites based on team need. Viral is most
    likely, but firestorm can make up for average crowd control.
