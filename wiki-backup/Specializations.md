Every Swat Officer must choose a Specialization upon creation. These
specializations are balanced to around 40% of
[Traits](Traits "wikilink").

for more details

*I personally think there's two ways to approach specs. You can either
pair it up with a trait for even more focused power, or you can
intentionally use the opposite to try to make up for one of your
weaknesses. Triage for example is a great way for a dummy to be able to
effectively use [Bandages](Consumables#bandage "wikilink") for healing
himself without having to spend his trait on
[Healer](Traits#healer "wikilink"). In the past, a dummy who wanted to
be self-sufficient at healing had to pick healer, or to a lesser degree,
[Flower Child](Traits#flowerchild "wikilink") or
[Gifted](traits#gifted "wikilink").* \~ redscull

A list of specs can be found on the [Official Swat
site](Http://redscull.com/swat/readmeafterspecs.html).

## ![](Spec-weaponry.jpg "Spec-weaponry.jpg") Weaponry

*Increases max ammo level by 1 and effective weapon-skill level by 1.
Assault rifles fire antipersonnel rounds. Plasma Rounds do extra
damage.*

Assault rifles fire antipersonnel rounds. Medics will have twice the
bonus as they naturally have this ability. This affects enemy
[LAD](Assault_Droid "wikilink")s, Tyrants, Umbrella Soldiers, Umbrella
Commandos, Nemesis Mini-Droids, and Nemesis.

Plasma Rounds and Plasma V-Rounds do 1-6 more damage depending on the
gun level.

**Usage**: This Specialization synergizes with
[Dragoon](Traits#Dragoon "wikilink") to maximize damage output via the
player's weapon. Weaponry also synergizes with other Traits that
increase weapon damage or attack speed, such as
[Prowler](Traits#Prowler "wikilink"), [Chem
Reliant](Traits#Chem_Reliant "wikilink"), or [Flower
Child](Traits#Flower_Child "wikilink").

## ![](Spec-power.jpg "Spec-power.jpg") Power Armor

*Increases damage absorption by 3.2 and armor by 1. Reduces movement
speed penalty of Shield Capacitor. Death does not damage power armor.*

This specialization is designed around the [Shield
Capacitor](Lab#shieldcap "wikilink") item. Shield Capacitor reduces the
Officer's move speed by 20 for Light, Medium, and Heavy Armors, and 30
for Advanced Armors. The Power Armor spec reduces the penalty by 20,
bringing Advanced Armor down to only 10 penalty, and reversing the full
penalty for the other armors. The [Cyborg](Cyborg "wikilink") will lose
20 movement speed upon using the [Goliath
Modification](Cyborg#goliathmod "wikilink") regardless of Power Armor
specialization. Thus a Cyborg using Goliath in addition to holding a
Shield Capacitor will lose 50 move speed without the Power Armor spec,
so utilizing this spec will bring that total down to just 30.

While the eliminated move speed reduction is nice, the high point is the
Damage Absorption to % Incoming Damage synergy. On a 150 damage hit
(albeit a weak zombie hit, but it illustrates well):

| Assume Level 19 Nanites   | Armor Type          | HP Dmg before Armor | % vs. Large Nanites |
|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Large Nanites             | Heavy               | 6.2                 | 100.0%              |
| Large Nanites w/ PA Spec  | Heavy               | 3.0                 | 48.4%               |
| Large+ Nanites            | Heavy w/ Shield Cap | 4.7                 | 75.8%               |
| Large+ Nanites w/ PA Spec | Heavy w/ Shield Cap | 1.5                 | 24.2%               |

Here, Power Armor is already reducing health damage taken by about 50%,
which is reason enough for health-dependent tanks like
[HOs](Heavy_Ordnance "wikilink") to take this (on harder hits, the
advantage is reduced though never eliminated). Likewise, the Shield
Capacitor reduces the amount of health damage taken by around 24% for
non-PA heroes. On a PA hero, the Shield Capacitor reduces the damage
taken by 50% instead of the typical \~25%. Shield Capacitors will always
help the health of PA heroes more than non-PA heroes. **A Heavy+ PA tank
is taking less than half the health damage of a Heavy non-PA tank for
hits up to 230 damage.** While PA is nice without a Shield Cap, you
should make sure to buy a Shield Cap if you use this specialization.

**Usage**: If you want to get the full effect of this specialization,
pair it with a tanking trait, like [Acrobat](Traits#Acrobat "wikilink"),
[Survivalist](Traits#Survivalist "wikilink"),
[Gadgeteer](Traits#Gadgeteer "wikilink") or, to a lesser extent,
[Dragoon](Traits#Dragoon "wikilink") .

## ![](Spec-energy.jpg "Spec-energy.jpg") Energy Cells

*Storage Cells items increase maximum energy capacity by an extra 250
each.*

Items that benefit from the Energy Cells spec are: Storage Cell, Storage
Duo-Cell, Storage Generator, Storage Generator MkII, SuperCell, and any
[Engineered Item](Traits#Engineer "wikilink") that combines any of the
prior list.

**Usage**: Energy Cells can be paired with
[Energizer](Traits#Energizer "wikilink") for maximum energy storage. It
also pairs well with [Engineer](Traits#Engineer "wikilink") since you
can replicate several storage items that give you a bonus. Note that the
player still starts the game with 1000 energy. Otherwise pair it with a
class that needs extra energy capacity such as
[tanks](Aspects_of_a_Class_Call#tank "wikilink"),
[Medics](Field_Medic "wikilink"), [Pyros](Pyrotechnician "wikilink"),
[Watchman](Watchman "wikilink") or [Demos](Demolitions "wikilink").
Demos in particular benefit from this because of the boost to
[Biochem](Demolitions#biochem "wikilink").

## ![](Spec-cybernetics.jpg "Spec-cybernetics.jpg") Cybernetics

*Increases health by 50 and intelligence by 3-5. Movement speed
increased by 75 while health is critical. Head injuries reduce
intelligence by less.*

Higher intelligence classes gain more int from choosing cybernetics as
their specialization. Thus [Medic](Field_Medic "wikilink") and
[Psychologist](Psychologist "wikilink") gain 5;
[Cyborg](Cyborg "wikilink"), [Demo](Demolitions "wikilink"),
[Tactician](Tactician "wikilink"), and [Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink")
gain 4; and the rest of the classes gain 3.

Critical health is defined as \<167 hp (1/3 the hp of the normal 500).

A typical head injury reduces the Officer's
[intelligence](intelligence "wikilink") by 33% (1/3). Both Cybernetics
and [Gifted](Traits#Gifted "wikilink") each reduce that penalty. So if
you have just Cybernetics, a head injury will take 20% of your
intelligence, and if you have both Cybernetics and Gifted, you only lose
11% (1/9) of your intelligence from a head injury.

**Usage**: Pairing this with
[Survivalist](Traits#survivalist "wikilink") allows the player to gain
additional health and health regen while critical. It can also be paired
with [Gifted](Traits#gifted "wikilink") or
[Prowler](Traits#prowler "wikilink") for the movement speed bonuses, or
with Gifted for the extra [white intelligence](intelligence "wikilink")
plus head injury reduction stacking.

## ![](Spec-triage.jpg "Spec-triage.jpg") Triage

*Bandages fully recover recipient from critically low health, don't
cause recently bandaged status, and restore an additional 25 health when
used on self. Increases the auto-stack size of bandages by 100%.
Antidote never fails to convert zombie and is more likely to finalize
inoculation.*

This spec is fully focused on bandages and the civing objective. For
bandages, recovering from critically low health means if the unit you
are healing is in critical (\<167 hp), it will first heal the unit to
168 hp, and then apply the health it would have healed anyways on top of
pulling the unit out of critical. Another big benefit of Triage is not
causing the recently bandaged status. This status makes future bandage
use on this unit less effective and prevents
[Healer](Traits#Healer "wikilink") Trait Officers from repairing
injuries until the status wears off (20 sec unless reset by another
bandage).

For civing, "Antidote never fails to convert zombie" means that your
Antidote will always convert a zombie into the blue passive zombie, it
does not mean never fails to convert a zombie into a human (final
inoculation). However, being Triage does increase the chances to
finalize the inoculation of the passive zombie (remove the "sparkly
status").

**Usage**: If you want to get the full effect of this specialization,
pair it [Healer](Traits#healer "wikilink") for fast sure-fire
[civing](civs "wikilink") and great
healing/[injury](conditions "wikilink") removal. Also, pair it with
[Gadgeteer](Traits#gadgeteer "wikilink") to create massive (60)
[bandage](Consumables#bandage "wikilink") stacks.

## ![](Spec-chemistry.jpg "Spec-chemistry.jpg") Chemistry

*Buffout, Speed, and Mentats are consumed in thirds but still provide
their full bonus.* *[Reduces the experience penalty for
overdosing](Items#tocItems4 "wikilink").* *Intelligence is +10 for the
purpose of using stims. Additionally, stims last 33% longer, provide 33%
more attack speed and 33% more move speed when applied to yourself.*

**Usage**: Best Effect - If you want to get the full effect of this
specialization, pair it with [Flower
Child](Traits#flowerchild "wikilink") OR [Chem.
Reliant](Traits#chemreliant "wikilink") to triple the mileage of your
drugs. Pair this with [Gadgeteer](Traits#gadgeteer "wikilink") or
[Tinkering](Talents#tinkering "wikilink") to maximize stim potential on
less intelligent classes with high energy regeneration, such as
[Mavericks](Maverick "wikilink") or [Watchmans](Watchman "wikilink").

## ![](Spec-leadership.jpg "Spec-leadership.jpg") Leadership

*Increases initial valor by 12-14. Can assign 1 extra skill point to a
comrade. Increases movement speed of civilians by 10%. Issuing a move or
patrol command creates a movement indicator.*

Higher intelligence classes gain more valor from choosing this
specialization. Thus [Medic](Field_Medic "wikilink") and
[Psychologist](Psychologist "wikilink") gain 14;
[Cyborg](Cyborg "wikilink"), [Demo](Demolitions "wikilink"),
[Tactician](Tactician "wikilink"), and [Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink")
gain 13; and the rest of the classes gain 12.

The movement speed boost is stacked by power (1 - 0.9 ^ Leaderships) and
affects cured civilians, a [Tactician](Tactician "wikilink")'s Recruits
(either Cadet or Woman), and a [Watchman's
Paradox](Watchman#Paradox "wikilink") units excluding Military Android.
The bonus is based on 220 move speed, regardless of the starting move
speed of the unit. Thus the first Leadership Officer adds +22 move
speed, the second adds +19.8, and so on, with the ninth Leadership
Officer adding just +9.5 move speed. Total bonus move speed with 9
Leadership Officers would be +134.8 move speed.

**Usage**: This specialization is one of self-sacrifice. Because each
specialization is designed to be worth \~2 skill points, this lets you
essentially place those two skill points on another hero (15 valor can
buy 1 skill point at the lab). Choose this if another teammate could
fulfill his or her [role](Aspects_of_a_Class_Call "wikilink") better by
a greater margin with those two skill points than you would be able to
fulfill yours. Also when you issue a "move" command an orb appears on
the ground, this is useful to help new players with pathing if you want
to, for instance, get them on the wall, you can put an orb circle on the
ground where you want them to be.

## ![](Spec-robotics.jpg "Spec-robotics.jpg") Robotics

*Officer is accompanied by a pet robot which can employ a vulnerability
scanner, zephyr field, or minor energy field.*

The [robo-pet you
receive](http://redscull.com/swat/unitinfo-robopet.htm) is based on what
Class of Officer you choose. The robo-pet comes with 3 abilities to
choose from and you can only have 1 active at a time. To choose a new
ability, click Reboot and you can choose a new one. In order to reboot,
your main Officer must be alive and within 900 range. The 3 abilities
are:

-   Vulnerability Scanner: -1 Armor in a 625 radius to all enemy units
-   Zephyr Field: +10% move & attack speed to friendly mechanical units
    in a 900 radius (includes invulnerable units such as a
    Hyper-thashing Kami or Phased Mini-Droids)
-   Minor Energy Field: +1 eps to friendly mechanical units in a 900
    radius (only vulnerable units)

**Usage**: This is a powerful specialization if it's taken full
advantage of. Because the robot ally is invulnerable, he should always
be standing as close to the action as possible so his vulnerability
scanner (-1 armor aura) can be put to the most use. Otherwise, keep the
robot close to any robotic units in the group such as
[robodogs](Robo "wikilink") and [Mini2s](Mini-Droid_MkII "wikilink"). If
you simply have the robot follow on your hero, you are probably not
using this to its full effect.

## ![](Spec-espionage.jpg "Spec-espionage.jpg") Espionage

*There are two variants of this Spec depending on which class chooses
it. ([Covert Sniper](Covert_Sniper "wikilink") or Non-[Covert
Sniper](Covert_Sniper "wikilink"))*

### Covert Sniper

*Surveillance cameras cost half as much energy to construct. Movement
speed increased by 30 while sneaking, and sprint duration increased by 2
seconds.*

**Usage:** This specialization is very useful on both solo snipers and
group snipers. For solo snipers, it helps you clear the map must more
quickly, allowing you to sprint longer and giving additional move speed
while sneaking in addition to the cheaper cameras for later teleporting
of items. For group snipers, it helps you to keep
[cameras](Covert_Sniper#Construct_Camera "wikilink") up for visibility
around the group and allows you to short scout around the group quicker.

### Non-Covert Sniper

*Officer is cloaked while idle and moving. Decreases energy regeneration
by 8-33% and effective Nanites level by 1.*

If you are an espionage non-Covert Sniper, you can
[Sneak](Covert_Sniper#Sneak "wikilink") your Officer similar to how
Covert Snipers can by double-clicking hold (or double-tapping "H" on
your keyboard). This will keep you from attacking nearby enemies until
you break your Sneak by a-clicking the ground. You can still manually
target enemies or cast abilities while Sneaking, but you'll stop
attacking again once that enemy is dead until you break your Sneak.

The decreased energy regeneration is based on Armor type: Light has -8%,
Medium -16%, and Heavy and Advanced have -33% energy regeneration.

**Usage**: This specialization is useful for classes that normally would
not be able to scout due to the room spawns or mobs. This allows more of
the team (if espionage officers are in-game) to go out and scout or rad
hunt freeing up time which normally could be wasted by letting a single
solo covert sniper scout much of the map. Although this specialization
gives better scouting for classes other than the Covert Sniper, it
incurs a penalty of a decrease in Nanites levels, which is a cost to
consider in addition to the decreased energy regeneration.
