## Trainable Abilities

### [Plasma Grenade](image:ability-gren.gif "wikilink") [Plasma Grenade](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-mav.htm#gren)

[rightPlasma](file:tooltip-grenade.jpg "wikilink") grenade can be made
more effective through the purchase of the grenade launcher item from
the Lab by increasing the damage and range at which your Plasma Grenade
skill can be used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Robodog](file:ability-mecha.gif "wikilink") [Robodog](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-mav.htm#robodog)

[rightThe](file:tooltip-upgradedog.jpg "wikilink") Robodog's natural
energy regeneration starts at 1 and increases by 1 every level up to
level 8.

The Robodog gets most of it's utility once 8 skill points are invested
into the skill. The mecha requires more investment to be effective
though.

Robodog is one of only two skills that can have more than 16 points
(Watchman Loadout is the second).

The last 8 points in Robodog are less effective than the first 16 and
should only be used as a skill sink if you have leftover skill points.

If you are near your dog when it dies then you will experience empathy,
decreasing your damage, armor, and draining health.

If you are near your dog when it dies (no message that it died far away)
then you are not required to stay near the area to rebuild it. You can
suffer the empathy for a while if needed and then rebuild your dog later
when you have regenned the mana if needed.

If your robodog dies far away you will not experience empathy, but must
get very near the place of the dog's death in order to revive it.

damage same radius).

The Chain Gun also receives a boost to its attack range by 75 (625).

[right](file:tooltip-mutation.jpg "wikilink")


Every time the hero increases in level, there is a chance this will
mutate into a second trait.

It will never turn into Skilled, Swift Learner, Pack Rat, or a duplicate
the Mav's primary trait

If a maverick has both flower child and chem reliant traits they will
receive 4x effect of drugs, and 2.5 duration(5 minutes).//


## Good Builds

### Sniper + Mecha Main Tank

Author: Valcrist77

Sniper Rifle/Gadgeteer/Cybernetics/Hacking + Mecha Mutt

-   1 Plasma Grenade, 1 Advance Gen, 1 Dog, rest into Nanites
-   8 Dog
-   Get to 16 Dog, 10 Nanites
-   14 Nanites
-   Max Advance Gen
-   Max Dog

Getting your Robodog to level 8 is going to be your first priority, to
give it more regen, cap, armor, evasion, and vitality.

Keep dog on max vitality.

16 points in dog gives it 1000e cap.

1 point in grenade helps deal with innards and gives a little bit of CC.

Use your sniper rifle to shoot gray zombies on your dog.

Stand next to your dog to give it bonus regen - this bonus scales on
your hero's advance gen, so be sure to level that up as much as
possible.

Points into Mecha beyond 16 gives a bit more evasion and vitality,
helpful for high man Extinction games.

Gadgeteer + Cyber allows you to use your own Riot Shield and a Combat
Vest 2, giving your hero and dog more armor to tank.

Make sure your dog, hero, and locker has batteries to help tank in
difficult situations. Request them from your QM whenever your team has
the money to buy it. Get them yourself from ABMs whenever you pass by.

### X + Kami

Author: Valcrist77

Suggested Traits: , , , , 

What trait/specs you took, what you mutate, and your gun/dog choice is
going to influence the rest of your build.

Getting a Kami up to level 8 (7 points into dog) is required for max
Thrash skill, and level 9 (8 points into dog) is required for max Shadow
Pack Size (4). Further points allows for higher level in Turbo, lower
Multi-Thrash Cooldown, more energy, and more agility.

Maxing your weapon skill is an excellent way to take advantage of your
guns superior base stats.

Maverick is a naturally high energy class, making it a good class to use
Plasma Grenade, Plasma Rounds (Chain gun), Freeze Ray, Nano Inject, and
refilling Stim Packs.

Sample Builds:

S+K/Heavy/Sniper Rifle/Gadgeteer/Chemistry/Hacking

-   15 Kami
-   8 Critical Strike
-   1 Plasma Grenade
-   14 Nanites
-   Rest into Plasma Grenade, Advance Gen, or Nanites
-   Max Thrash and Turbo on Kami

Old Sample Builds:

Self-Stim A+K Heavy/Assult Rifle/Gadgeteer/Chemistry/Running Kami 1
grenade, 8 kami, 16 rifle, 16 kami. Spare points into gen. Use
self-applied refined stims and a Rapid Reload mk2 when you can. CR or
Energizer mutates would be great.

Priority Focus S+K Heavy/Sniper Rifle/Chem Reliant/Weaponry/Running Kami
1 grenade, 8 kami, 8 crit, 16 kami, rest in gen or grenade. FC or
Dragoon mutates would be great.

Tank and CC R+M Heavy/Rocket Launcher/Swift Learner/Cells/Running Mecha
1 grenade, 8 mecha, 4 grenade, 16 mecha, 4 gen, 8 grenade, rest into
gen. Dragoon, Engineer, or Gadgeteer mutates would be great.

Solo C+K Light/Chaingun/RadResist/Espionage/Running Spend 1 point in gun
and 8 points in nade right away. Don't enter rooms while visible unless
absolutely necessary - your dog should do much of the early work. Get
nanites up to a safe level (12-19) and get 1 point in grenade. You are
now safe to enter rooms and use your gun. Get 7-12 effective gun and
more nanites and regen to go with it. Reprogram your dog into nanites
while moving haz so that you can safely keep mob off of you.

## More Information

### Hints/Tips

-   The Maverick is equipped with an [MkII
    version](http://redscull.com/swat/readmeafterweapons.html) of
    whatever weapon he chooses.
-   It is often a good idea to plan on maxing the Maverick's gun skill
    as he has a superior gun relative to every other class.
-   The Technician can upgrade a Robodog's health (orange circuit board)
    by 50, but by doing so makes it much harder for the dog to draw mob.
    Currently it is very bad to upgrade a Mecha's health. If you want to
    remove an orange mod, reprogram the dog with its nanites on.
-   1 level in Plasma Grenade is a very good counter to innards as it
    well get them in critical health if it just doesn't kill them right
    off.
-   Make sure to have your Maverick in one control group and your dog in
    another so you can micro their movement separately. If you need to
    make use of items/skills on the Maverick use waypoints (shift key)
    to keep your dog moving if necessary.
-   Unlocking the pyro is done by soloing hard with a rank 1 flame mav.
