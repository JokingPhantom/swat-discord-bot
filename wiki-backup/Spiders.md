bastards rise up from rooms with surprise attacks and quick deadly
damage.// These are very deadly to low level snipers and often enough
reason for a sniper not to enter a room while scouting. They are largely
anti snipers because of the large numbers and the sniper's lack of
splash. Against enemies with a flamethrower or rocket launcher their
effectiveness is severely shortened by their low life. Avoid entering
rooms needlessly to avoid encountering these spiders.

Although not a real skill they use, they always started burrowed and
rise up in a surprise attack.

A standard spider skill, they unleash a web upon the hero and halt his
movement. Being caught in room literally happens as you can't run out
when caught by spiders. This ability can only be used by the first
spider that spawns and only at the moment that he unspawns.

Sight:\*\* (95 radius) A threat to snipers who panic. Snipers should
stick to the edges of the room to avoid the detection range of spawned
spiders.

## Notes

Spiders only spawn moments after someone enters a room and are not part
of normal zombie waves. Spiders can spawn from certain Abomination
corpses. Spiders have unusual pathing abilities and can actually crawl
through walls.

If you are a cloaked solo sniper and hear spiders spawning, do not
sprint immediately. The first spider that spawns is the only one that
can web you, and will only do it when it spawns. If you are cloaked and
outside of its truesight radius, you will avoid the web entirely. If you
do get unlucky enough to be webbed, do not try to shoot back. Concussion
grenade on yourself can slow their attacks until the web wears off.
Sprint can give 100% evasion until the web wears off and you can move to
safety. Spiders should not be a problem if you don't panic. Try to avoid
the middle of rooms. If you are at the edge you have less of a chance of
a spider (or dog) spawning directly on you and thus seeing through your
cloak. Set up a camera to decide if you need to go into a room at all,
and wait until your cloak is back on before entering. If you need to
open boxes you should move around the room stealthily, as if spiders are
always about to appear. If you need to shoot a rad try to do so from
outside of the room.

The Psy's [Mind Rot](Psychologist#mindrot "wikilink") also works on
spiders, so use this to help clear a comrade.

Spiders should only spawn moments after someone enters a room. If the
group decides to take a shortcut through a room, there is a high chance
that spiders will spawn and someone will be webbed. Cover each other and
the group will never have any problem with these low-health units.
