Some of these items have int requirements and are found in wooden
crates. If one wooden crate has a stat booster, all the wooden crates in
that room will contain stat boosters. Items with prices can be bought at
the Lab or an ABM. ABM's require 2 reactors to be online before they can
be active for buying and selling.

## Stim Packs

*Stim pack items grant a bonus to attack speed and move speed for 20
seconds. They start with 8 charges, and can be refilled to 3 charges
with energy once depleted.*

-   Stim Pack: *+75% attack speed, +15% move speed, 20 seconds*

\>\> *120 int, 600e refill, 400 credits from ABM*

-   Refined Stim Pack: *+150% attack speed, +15% move speed, 20 seconds*

\>\> *135 int, 1000e refill, 400 credits from ABM*

-   Ultra Stim Pack: *+225% attack speed, +15% move speed, 20 seconds*

\>\> *150 int, 1200e refill*

-   [Gadgeteer](Traits#gadgeteer "wikilink") heroes will refill to 4
    charges. [Packrat](Traits#packrat "wikilink") rat can drop regular
    stim packs with a single charge sometimes.
-   Give Stim Packs to Characters who are constantly paying attention to
    the group and have enough energy regeneration or energy to spam Stim
    Packs.
-   It is often a good idea to store packs of ultras that the team finds
    so that high intelligence characters or stim-specced heros can use
    these during the \[Nemesis\] fight in Nightmare or Extinction.
-   Classes that will reach the 120 intelligence necessary to use a
    regular Stim Pack include the Psychologist (level 13), the Medic
    (level 10), Demolitions (level 37), the Cyborg (level 26), Tech Ops
    (level 39-46 depending on rank), and the Tactician (level 15).
-   Classes that will have the 135 intelligence necessary to use a
    Refined Stim Pack include the Psychologist (level 31), the Medic
    (level 25), the Tactician (level 36),and the Cyborg (level 50).
-   Classes that will reach the 150 intelligence required to use this
    item include the Psychologist (level 50 or less depending on how
    many skill points are put into Mental Clarity) and the Medic (level
    40).

## Batteries

-   **Battery:** *Restores 500e on use. Automatically used if hero drops
    below 250e.*
-   *Sold in stacks of 1 for 120 credits from an ABM or the Lab.*
-   *Pack Rat can drop stacks of 1, 2, or 3 from the Feed Rad ability.*
-   *Stacks up to 4. [Gadgeteer](Traits#gadgeteer "wikilink") stacks to
    5.*
-   Note that the hero must have less than 250 mana for an auto use to
    occur. It is a good item to constantly pass the [Heavy
    Ordinance](HO "wikilink") one-stacks of batteries to fill up to four
    charges and pass around the party, so make sure the HO has batteries
    to charge all the time.
-   Because energy is the most important defensive resource, during
    Nemesis fights, all players should typically devote an inventory
    spot to a stack of batteries.
-   These are key for filling tors in lower-man games.
-   By having a sniper TP the HO a battery as the HO uses recharge batt
    it can cause the battery to have 1 more per stack than is should (no
    batteries are gained) but a non-gadgeteer HO can charge a 5 stack.

## Bandages

-   **Bandages:** *Heals an organic unit proportional to the user's
    Intelligence.*

\>\> *64 credits for 8 Bandages from ABM or Lab*

-   Heals targets HP. Removes one "level" of open wound debuff per use.
    Higher intelligence produces larger heals.
    [Healer](Traits#healer "wikilink") trait increases HP restored by
    +50 (+17\~ intelligence), removes [open
    wounds](conditions#openwound "wikilink") more effectively, as well
    as removes one [injury](conditions "wikilink") provided the target
    is not [recently bandaged](conditions#recentlybandaged "wikilink").
    Sold in stacks of 8, stacks to 24.
    [Gadgeteer](Traits#gadgeteer "wikilink") stacks to 30. [Pack
    Rat](Traits#packrat "wikilink") rat drops 4-8 bandanges in a stack.
    Only white and [green int](intelligence "wikilink") effects heals.
    [Triage](Specialization#triage "wikilink") increases the auto-stack
    size of bandages by 100%, fully recover recipient from critically
    low health before healing the normal amount and restore an
    additional 25 health when used on self. Heals amount of health by
    the formula: HP restored = (intelligence - 100) \* 3 (minimum 3).
-   Make sure any heroes with the [Healer](Traits#healer "wikilink")
    trait have at least 1 stack of bandages to help with the removal of
    [injuries](conditions "wikilink").

## Revive

-   **Revive:** *Revives an adjacent dead organic unit.*

\>\> *150 int, 250 credits from ABM or Watchman Pharmacist, cannot be
sold)*

-   Works on cadets and civilians. Revived heroes start with 500 hp and
    500 energy. Res sickness debuff is applied as well. 1 charge,
    doesn't normally stack. Cadets do not receive the "Rez Sickness"
    buff. [Healer](Traits#healer "wikilink") trait allows use of this
    item regardless of int and the Revives stack up to 8 times (10 as a
    gadge healer mav) and act as Ankh of Reincarnation.
-   Make sure each Hero with the Healer trait, has one revive in their
    inventory or locker just in case a team wipe occurs.
-   Classes that will reach the 150 intelligence required to use this
    item include the Psychologist (level 50 or less depending on how
    many skill points are put into Mental Clarity) and the Medic (level
    40). This can be fixed though by also buying a few mentats.

## Claymores

-   **Claymore:** *Sets a Claymore mine on the ground. Explodes for 400
    AoE damage when destroyed.*

\>\> *105 int, 180 credits for stack of 15 from Lab*

-   Claymores have 200 Health and 5 armor.
-   Gadgeteer can stack them to 18, but they are bought in stacks of 15
    from the Lab unlike dotes.
-   All Classes will have sufficient intelligence to use this item by
    level 18.
-   Claymores are spectacular early game at delaying and killing the mob
    while the team clears rooms.
-   Place claymores behind the team to delay the mob before approaching
    a [Reactor](Reactor "wikilink"). This will give the team additional
    time to fill without any pressure for the mob.
-   As with [C4](Demolitions#c4 "wikilink"), placing a claymore along a
    wall will reduce the number of targets that can attack it at once,
    delaying the mob for longer.

## Drugs

*Drug items provide a bonus to hero attributes for 2 minutes.* *There is
a lot of complexity surrounding their use.* *More information can be
found at [Drugs](Drugs "wikilink").*

-   **Buffout:** *+100 Vitality for 2 minutes*
-   **Speed:** *+10 Agility for 2 minutes*
-   **Mentat:** *+15 Intelligence for 2 minutes*
-   Heroes with the Flower Child and Chem. Reliant traits, or the
    Chemistry specialization, will be able to better utilize drugs.
-   Drugs can be very effective for soloing classes as it provides
    increased survivability at the cost of "1 item" (Pill Pouch).

Drugs affect stats and last for 2 minutes. Up to 30 total drugs can be
stored in the pill pouch (rank 2+) and the effects are modified by the
two traits Chem Reliant and Flower Child. [Pack
Rat](Traits#packrat "wikilink") has a chance to drop a random drug from
rat. [Chemistry](Specialization#chemistry "wikilink") specialization
enables drugs to be eaten in thirds from pill pouch. Eating too many
drugs at once will cause overdose debuff (wobbling screen and exp
penalty). The same drug only stack optimally at 4, wobbling begins with
the 4th active drug or the 6th if you are [Chem
Reliant](Traits#chemreliant "wikilink"). If a
[Maverick#mutate](Maverick#mutate "wikilink") has both Chem. Reliant and
Flower Child traits they will receive 4x effect, and 2.5 duration(5
minutes). Heroes are able to utilise a maximum of eight drugs at any
given time.

## Drug Overdose

Screen wobble starts when a player is one drug short of overdosing and
gets worse when further drugs are eaten. But the experience penalty does
not apply until the player eats one more drug and overdoses, so the
first drug which causes screen wobbliness is your cue that the next one
*will incur a penalty.* After a Flower Child has ever overdosed (5 drugs
at once, or 7 if a Mav and also Chem Reliant) then any subsequent use of
even one drug will induce screen wobble, but not experience loss until
drugged up to the normally required 5 (or 7 for FC + CR lucky mutated
Mav).

| Experience Penalty |
|--------------------|
| Drugs              |
| 4                  |
| 5                  |
| 6                  |
| 7                  |
| 8                  |

## Drug Tolerance

Consuming multiples of a single type of drug leads to diminishing
returns. The first four drugs of any given type will produce the full
effect, but further drugs of that type will have a lesser effect.
Tolerance is not shared between drugs; thus maintaining four Speed and
four Mentat will produce the full effect from each. The table below
summarizes the benefit at the margin when using multiple drugs of the
same type.

| Drug  |
|-------|
| Count |
| 4     |
| 5     |
| 6     |
| 7     |
| 8     |

Some of these items have int requirements and are found in wooden
crates. If one wooden crate has a stat booster, all the wooden crates in
that room will contain stat boosters. Items with prices can be bought at
the Lab or an ABM. ABM's require 2 reactors to be online before they can
be active for buying and selling.

## Ammo Upgrade

increase varies depending on the unit. See the [Weapons website
