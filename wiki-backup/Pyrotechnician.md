*The pyrotechnician is a special class that must be unlocked first
before he may be played.*

For statistics on the
[Pyrotechnician](http://redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm) see the
main SWAT page.

## Trainable Abilities

### [Molotov](image:ability-molotov.gif "wikilink") [Molotov](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#molotov)

[right](file:tooltip-molotov.jpg "wikilink")

-   Molotov's slow stacks with itself or other slows (ie. Spatial warp,
    Freeze Ray) to make it significantly stronger
-   Because slowing forces greater bunching of zombies, this skills
    increases the damage potential off all splashing abilities,
    especially flamethrowers. Synergizes well with Advanced Fuel.
-   Additional points only increase the duration - making them a weak
    choice compared to other skills.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Microwave](file:ability-micro.gif "wikilink") [Microwave](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#micro)

[right](file:tooltip-microwave.jpg "wikilink")

-   Super Grotesques killed by Microwave do not spawn Mini-Grotesques.
    Charred Mutants killed by microwave cannot revive. Beasts killed by
    microwave do not spawn beastlings.
-   Armor-ignoring, so particularly good for priority targets with high
    armor.
-   Useful for eliminating large clumps of mob. Hit the one with highest
    health so that maximum AoE damage will be dealt.
-   This ability will not deal full damage if used at maximum range. Use
    it within half range for maximum efficiency.
-   Keeping the damage this ability deals just ahead of mob health will
    help ensure that you pop as often as possible for crowd control
    purposes.
-   Microwave level 11 deals 100% explosion damage, being particularly
    effective for destroying clumps of mob.
-   Charge this ability by targetting yourself. There is a 6 second
    cooldown when charging. The one charge results in 2x damage when it
    is released. After two charges the damage will be 2.5x, then 2.75x,
    then 2.825x. The amount of damage done will approach but never reach
    3x.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Incendiary Rocket](file:ability-incrocket.gif "wikilink") [Incendiary Rocket](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#incrocket)

[right](file:tooltip-rockets.jpg "wikilink")

-   This skill is extremely effective against bosses and mini-bosses.
-   Be careful about using this ability on TNT units. It essentially
    places a timer on the bomb which may go off too close to a teammate.
-   The damage from multiple Incendiary Rockets will stack, but the
    armor debuff will not stack. However the damage ticks more often and
    for more damage, making multiple rockets extremely effective on
    bosses. Combined with a true boss killer (sniper's gun), this skill
    will do more damage to bosses than any other skill.
-   The damage from this skill increases with uber.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Advanced Fuel](file:ability-fuel.gif "wikilink") [Advanced Fuel](http://www.redscull.com/swatclassinfo-pyro.htm#fuel)

[right](file:tooltip-upgradefuel.jpg "wikilink")

-   Provides extreme gun damage when used in conjunction with [Turn Up
    the Heat](Pyrotechnician#heat "wikilink").
-   The team needs to accommodate strong flamethrowers to avoid wasting
    skill points. This means balance the team away from gun AoE and
    letting them focus their skills into other areas. Molotov combined
    with the massive gun damage will easily control the mob from a
    single direction.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Nanites](image:ability-nanites.gif "wikilink") [Nanites](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#nanites)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

## Innate Abilities

### [Firefly](image:ability-fly.gif "wikilink") [Firefly](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#ff)

[right](file:tooltip-firefly.jpg "wikilink")

-   Key for checking hard to get rooms or using as a temporary camera if
    there is no [Covert Sniper](Sniper "wikilink") in the group.
-   Don't place near where it will receive splash damage as this will
    kill it. If the Firefly is killed, it will not receive the residual
    [sight radius](sight "wikilink").
-   Flying units, bosses and umbrellas can attack it and kill it.



----

### [Combustion](image:item-battery.jpg "wikilink") [Combustion](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#combust)

[right](file:tooltip-combustoin.jpg "wikilink")

-   This ability should almost always be on cooldown. A good Pyro will
    always be using abilities.
-   Activate this ability as you start [filling a
    Reactor](Reactor "wikilink") to put in the maximum amount of energy.





------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Turn Up the Heat](image:ability-heat.gif "wikilink") [Turn Up the Heat](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#heat)

[right](file:tooltip-overburn.jpg "wikilink")

-   Great for crowd control when combined with some buffouts, just make
    sure not to stay away from your teammates while using.
-   Extremely useful if the medic has placed a mending station to keep
    up with the health drain.
-   This ability is a three-way toggle, just like the demos
    [SMA](Demolitions#sma "wikilink"). If you spam G when in your Z
    menu, it will shut off because of the cooldown on the activation.






------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Reinforced Plating](image:ability-replate.gif "wikilink") [Reinforced Plating](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-pyro.htm#replate)

[right](file:tooltip-reinforcedplating.jpg "wikilink")

-   This ability allows Pyro to tank flies quite effectively by turning
    off nanites temporarily.

## Good Builds

### Priority

*The recommended way to play Pyrotechnician.*

*Build A*: , ,

*Build B*: , ,

-   1 point molotov, microwave and rockets out of the bunker. Rest in
    nanites, or save *x* skill points you would prefer to spend on
    microwave instead
-   Rockets to 16, any saved skill points into microwave
-   Nanites to 10-19, rest in microwave with 0-2 more points in molotov

<!-- -->

-   The focus with this build is on using your skills, microwave and
    incendiary rockets to manage any priority (non-zombie) as well as
    bosses. As such, increased energy-boosting traits and specs are most
    valuable to the pyro.

<!-- -->

-   The pyro is very strong meaning nearly any trait/spec is highly
    effective. However, if playing full meta other high-performing
    traits would be Chem Reliant (if needing a chrono-user) or gadgeteer
    (if needing a qm). The downside to these are the item-dependence
    each require to be effective.
-   Microwave charred mutants, tnts, umbrella soldiers and commandoes
-   Rocket blue dogs, STNTs, icers, hyperghouls, bosses, and tommies

**Advantages**: High mobility/Highest dps on bosses/minibosses, Delays
need for Freeze Ray, Item-independent if following above builds

**Disadvantages**: Relatively weak CC, non-existent short-scouting vs.
other priority classes

### Crowd Control

*Build A*: , ,

*Build B*: , ,

-   1 point gun, molotov, microwave and rockets out of the bunker. Rest
    in nanites, or save *x* skill points you would prefer to spend on
    gun instead
-   Rockets to 4-10
-   Nanites to 10-19, rest in gun
-   0-2 more points in Molotov, rest in Microwave

<!-- -->

-   The focus with this build is on using your gun, and molotov to
    manage non-priority targets (zombies). As such, attack
    speed-boosting or damage traits/specs are most valuable.

**Advantages**: High splash-free damage with proper team placement,
high-innard control, moderate priority control even with low level
microwave/rocket

**Disadvantages**: Immobile CC, extremely weak cc with poor placement
(no stacking/bunching), non-existent short-scouting, requires drugs to
be effective

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## More Information

### Hints/Tips

-   Because flamethrowers are so good at damaging tightly packed units
    and have no friendly splash, they are ideal for clearing a tank
    during a boss fight. The pyro should position himself so the tank is
    closer to him than the boss is. This way he can hit stop and the
    hero will automatically acquire enemies hitting the tank instead of
    acquiring the boss. Molotovs will help slow the incoming mob,
    compressing them for every greater damage. The Pyro should move to
    accommodate wherever the tank must stand. As long as the Pyro is
    *not* shooting the boss, the mob will ignore him (see [boss
    aggro](Techniques#aggro "wikilink")).

<!-- -->

-   To Unlock the Pyrotechnician, you must beat Hard Difficulty with a
    **new** Rank 1 Maverick equipped with a Flamethrower. No computer or
    real player allies are allowed. Any dog type can be used. All rank
    experience and rank unlock caps are not given for winning as a
    maverick. Hence, you will be given a code for a rank 1 pyro with no
    exp. Putting this code into the next game will allow you to select
    the previously locked pyrotechnician class

### Guides

*Player submitted ways on how to play the class effectively*

### Standard Group Pyro:

Author: Valcrist77

**Build:** Trait: Energizer or Engineer

Specialization: Energy cells or cybernetics

Talent: Toughness

Having at least one intelligence boosting pick will let you use Freeze
Ray for Nemesis fight, which may be necessary if no one else can use it.

**Skill Build**:

-   1 molotov/1 microwave/1 rocket
-   Keep microwave at a level where it can still one shot normal mob. Do
    not keep it at level 1, or it will be too difficult to finish off
    charred mutants and super gargoyles.
-   10/14/19 nanites for early/mid/late game
-   Max rockets with excess points
-   Dump excess points into molotov and microwave. More molotov gives
    you more persistant slows, and more microwave will give you better
    clear and commie killing power.

**Guide:**

1.  Constantly use firefly to scout rooms. Be sure to call out any
    Hazmats, item rooms, ABMs, and other items of interest, so that your
    solo can mark it down.
2.  Firefly is helpful for clearing the fungal spawns, and for finding
    the Chronotech item in the park.
3.  Use firefly to provide vision during the night of moving mob.
4.  Early overburn can assist in holding the mob, especially when given
    attack speed boosts, though this is usually only during objectives
    when the team does not possess a better buff target.
5.  When fighting commandos, you can microwave the commander (the one
    with less armor), so the psy can slay it with less cooldown. If
    kiting the commandos, you can microwave all of them at 500 range,
    then wait 20 seconds and finish them all off. If working with a
    watchman xnade, microwave 60-70% of the full health commandos, then
    microwave the commandos that have been left alive xnaded, so that
    they are killed within the shortest interval possible. If working
    with an Ion Cannon, microwave all the commandos, then hit them with
    the Ion Cannon to finish them off. If working with normal group
    guns, microwave to finish off the commandos when they all reach low
    health. In all situations, attempt to minimize the interval during
    the commandos die, to reduce chances of them reviving and killing
    you in revenge.
6.  Use microwave on fast moving, low-medium HP targets, such as TNT
    zombies, TNT dogs, fume zombies, etc. You can use microwave on high
    health targets as well, but only once and if you have a surplus of
    energy - this is most useful to attempt to reduce damage from
    blinking hyperghouls.
7.  Use Rockets on all bosses, tommies, hyperghouls, Super Gargoyles,
    blue dogs, and any other high HP target. You may hold off on certain
    targets, if killing them will damage or inconvenience the group,
    such as a poorly positioned Sludge, STNT, or tnt ghoul.
8.  Careful about the splash damage from a high level microwave when
    killing a target with substantial amounts of HP left - it can kill
    teammates you were trying to save in niche situations.
9.  High energy cap will enable you to use combustion more efficiently,
    and spend your mana when there is a surplus.
10. You will rarely need to charge your microwave, since charging it can
    leave you vulnerable to fast priorities, and keeping it leveled high
    enough to one shot mob will give you plenty of room to hit
    priorities. Only charge it during safe times, or after Nemesis
    teleports away.
11. Microwaving Nemesis can give your team a little bit of extra DPS.
    The microwave status debuff expires after 20 seconds. This is one of
    the most useful times to use a charged microwave.

### Unlocking the Pyro

As said above, to unlock the pyro you must solo hard with a brand new
(rank 1) flame mav.

#### 1. Pick your dog:

a\. **Kami** - Balanced flame dps well by killing priority and bosses

b\. **Mecha** - Tank bosses indefinitely on hard

c\. **Chrome** - Inferior to Kami in all relevant aspects

#### 2. Pick your trait and spec:

*Useful Traits*

is particularly useful as it gives you the best vest possible, increased
hp regen, injury protection, and an extra item slot.

will allow you to use most items, carry 12-stacks of antidotes, build
the LAD with items, and use a riot shield on your mecha if you choose.

gives a nice combination of move speed and attack speed.

will help you tank and provides a long sprint when needed.

is useful for all things, including healing, tanking, and tor filling.

will get you that early boost you may need

and will give you more of a boost but later

can cure injuries and keep your hitpoints high throughout the game, as
well as helping with civs.

provides extra health, intel, and survivability when you hit low health.

is useful for doting and mainly for self healing.

gives you an extra skill point to start with, almost enough valor to buy
another skill point when you reach the lab, and speeds up your civs.

will boost your dog or can provide -1 armor aura, just be sure to number
your robot and not leave it behind.

is only slightly useful but its utility comes later.

*Weaker Traits*

and have little use without a pill pouch.

is similarly of less-than-normal use (and does not come with the normal
initial drugs), but with 10 minutes between doses it is possible to pass
by drug rooms or abms when you need drugs.

is not extremely useful on a flame mav, particularly during those
dangerous early levels before you have found 5 ammo.

is almost useless without a rad scanner, but will help with the rad
objective and protect you from rad bolts.

is only nice to have many copies of a few low int items or use a CV1
sooner. Since you need a variety of items, every item is yours, and you
are probably not going to build design plan items anyway, engi is of
little use.

helps speed you up and provides +5 int, but is largely useless.

is an interesting one. Without a locker you do not get its full effect.
However, because you don't have a locker or rest of the team to carry
more items, PackRat becomes marginally more useful. PackRat can allow
you to carry huge amounts of batteries to fill tors, extra bandages to
keep yourself safe, or extra antidotes to make civving easier. All these
consumables are available while you still can have active item slots for
cells, mfgs, and a vest. PackRat is more work, so if you are unfamiliar
with PackRat I would not recommend it.

is best used with a shield cap and heavy tanking, which is not needed
while unlocking the pyro.

is most useful with multiple cells items, and unfortunately your
inventory is fairly packed already (though this might be useful with
PackRat).

could help you run away when needed, but generally it is better to kill
the mob continually and espi won't help you run from boss fights.

#### 3. Skill Points

-   At least 1 nade is important.
-   8 points in dog is an early goal, but do not neglect nanites.
-   A few points in regen will feel very helpful.
-   The rest of your points may depend on your style - if you have
    attack speed boosts put points in flame, if you have extra energy
    regen put points in nade, if you just have lots of extra points
    spend more in dog, especially if you have a mecha or are beyond
    level 35.

#### 4. Strategy

If possible, quickly head to the lab to build the LAD. This will require
4 mentats unless you have another intel boost (such as gadge, engi with
a few int, gifted, or cybernetics), and it is best to avoid eating the
mentats until you know you will be able to safely build the LAD
(remember building the LAD takes all your energy). If you can avoid
burning a batt after building the LAD (camp until you regen to 250 and
can pick your batts up, or carry them on your dog) then those batts will
be available for emergencies or reactor filling.

You need to get rads under control and a few levels. Pathing safely is
very important. Dog dancing and effective reprogramming is the major key
to any mav play. Note that reprogramming even a Kami for 19 light
nanites is as energy efficient as a heavy with 10 nanites, plus the dog
has evasion and self-healing, and can regen mana quickly with another
reprogram.

It is usually easiest to start with civs and get some money. This money
will afford you batteries to start filling tors.

If you use a mecha, get a shield cap on your dog as soon as possible.

If you use a kami, reprogram to thrash a boss and try to bounce the boss
between your LAD and Mav. It is possible to never take a hit with any
unit with enough bouncing skill, but it is certainly a good idea to get
nanites for the safety.

When filling the damaged tor, see if you can do it without battery
usage. Reprogramming your dog for regen (extra into nanites or turbo)
can actually allow you to fill the entire damaged tor with just the dog.

Do what you can. Get partial power up and buy additional batts from an
ABM is the lab is bought out. Keep bandages handy if possible, though
your innate heal will not cost money if money is more limiting than
energy. Always check rooms for rads, as you will not be able to quickly
rad scan to clean them up at the end. Finishing civs (or overachieving)
will help with rads. Rebuilding the LAD with a rad scanner will help you
finish up the rad objective.

### Unlocking Pyro 2.0

*The old guide above was written long ago in a different, close-minded
meta. I don't agree with the much of the information and flat-out
disagree with certain points as well. I have created this guide in order
to share what I feel is an easier alternative to unlocking the pyro.*

#### 1. General Strategy

Rather than take a more traditional approach to your game involving a
tank/crowd control slow moving group, we exploit the fact that hard uber
has very low hp and slow zombies. These weaker zombies let us use
claymores to do almost all of the killing while you rush objectives.
This guide assumes you understand how to reprogram your dogs abilities,
how to use light armor to survive by sprinting, how to do the drop-trick
to autoshoot TA on the move and how to micro your hero and dog at a
basic level (2 separate control groups).

This strategy works for the following reasons:

-   At this Uber, zombies start with 250 health. Claymores do 400 aoe
    damage which means they one-shot the mob for a very long time.
-   You get overpaid for reactors in Hard - 1200/1500/1800 for
    damaged/badly/sev meaning you profit off of tors even after battery
    cost. This creates a snowball effect where each objective you do
    makes the next easier as you have more disposable capital
-   Most things that would punish you for forgoing nanites do not exist
    or are extremely rare/unlucky to get on hard (ie. no blue dogs,
    reduced chance of a horror, rad zombies, tyrants spawning)
-   Those hazards that do make it through die *very* fast to a kami.
    This coupled with a delayed boss spawn time (9 minutes on hard)
    means there is very little that can actually harm you during the
    bulk of the objectives.

#### 2. Preparation

a\. *Hero*

This strategy works best with a very specific combination.

*Suggested Trait* -  - Speed boost aids in survivability, the int lets
us use claymores right away and recall quickly (level 18 instead of 35).

*Suggested Specialization* - Mandatory - aids in maneuvering through
map, allows us to not spend points on nanites

*Suggested Armor* - Light, the goal here is speed. The only dangers
presented to you in hard are avoidable given our strategy.

*Suggested Dog* - Kamikaze Canine. Necessary for killing bosses/priority
that are the only threat to you. High movement speed with turbo allows
you to scout rads effectively.

Arguments could be made for Skilled/Swift Learner/Reckless but the
experience gain from Hard Difficulty makes skill points less valuable.
Gadgeteer is also possible for improved stack sizes and immediate recall
but I personally value the 30 move speed when 10 dotes can easily fill
an apc and you begin the game with 10 batteries.

b\. *Bunker*

An important bunker spawn reduces the difficulty considerably. Your goal
is to have 1-2 tors very close (2-3 rooms away at the most). While not a
mandatory requirement, having a close tor to rush means the difference
between finishing the the first tor at 2 minutes vs 3-4 minutes when
there are significantly more zombies and priority on the map.

#### 3. Skill Point Distribution

-   8 points in dog
-   1 nade, 3-4 points in gen, 16 dog
-   Whatever you'd like, (game should be over relatively soon) I
    recommend more gen or nanites if worried about survivability.

#### 4. Starting Strategy

*This assumes you've followed my advice and selected light/gifted/espi
as your mav*

0:00

-   Pick hard, select your hero quickly (see above for traits). The
    longer you take in choosing the hero, the more zombies will have
    spawned.
-   Put first skill point into dog. An argument could be made for plasma
    nade, but you should rarely have to kill anything/leave stealth and
    we want the dog strong for the first boss.
-   Pick up the Temporal Avatar and any tats then start heading to first
    tor. Have dog run alongside you to give it some mana. I usually spec
    dog into energy if its with me or speed on its own. Dog is very
    fragile for first 5 minutes of the game, it should just do some
    light scouting.

0:05-0:25

-   Reached first tor, have begun filling
-   Dog should aim to scout 1-2 rooms while you fill. There are no
    ghouls/gargs/mutants this early and your flame can kill zombies on
    its own. Use charges of TA to hold if necessary (ie. filling near
    the graveyard).

2:00

-   Finished first tor - paid 1200-1800
-   Still have 3-5 bats left (3 from badly, 5 from damaged), 1 tat
-   Start scouting to lab
    -   Only open browns and ATMEs. All we're looking for are
        ammo/battery stacks/a cap atme (solars/supercell/Drug Rep). You
        do not have room for anything else, and items are not necessary
        at this difficulty, they only slow you down.

3:30

-   Should be at lab by now. Buy 2 stacks of clays and enough bats to
    get to get to 7 (4 stack + 1 stack). Drop the tat in lab for now.
    Inventory should be 3 bats, 4 bats, TA and 2 claymores.
-   Start laying clays away from the graveyard or where you just pathed
    from. Aim towards a tor on the side of the map you haven't been to.
    Try to slowly scout on the way, you would like to be outside the tor
    while the clays are used up to get xp.

6:30

-   Filled 2nd tor, partial power is on
-   Loop back to lab, buy a recall, pickup the tat and get antidotes,
    claymore and make sure you have a 4-stack of bats. Inventory = 4
    bats, TA, Recall, Antidotes, mentat, claymores
-   Clay to apc, *after* you have reached a few zombies. You don't want
    to keep all the zombies away, you need to civ.

9:00-10:00 First boss spawn

-   You're now in a good position with APC almost done and partial
    power.
-   Recall for some more clays and do another tor (eat the mentat, use
    the recall and get clays and enough bats). (inventory = TA, Recall,
    FRESH Antidotes, claymore, 6-8 bats)

Some time later...

-   With 3rd tor up and first boss dead you need to get 4 more civs,
    luckily you got fresh dotes after that APC. Head to the televac that
    just surged, scouting along the way. If you find mob being
    overwhelming then head to the lab to find clays.
-   If played right all objectives, save rads, are done before the 2nd
    boss
-   Rads just need to be scouted but you are invisible and much faster
    than the mob. The dog can finish rads while you afk outside rooms.

General Advice

-   There is 0 reason for you to shoot, almost never. You should sneak
    and let the dog or the TA do all the killing (the TA will shoot as
    you stand afk invis, or it will shoot with item drop trick).
-   Keeping dog as the short scout keeps you alive
-   Don't be afraid to let dog die if you're near it. You can wander off
    invis and revive it in a safer location
-   To check what type of room (implants vs consumables) try to hit
    boxes stacked so the flame can bounce.
-   If you are feeling adventurous and have the mentats available, make
    the LAD and put the first 8 points in rad scan. This gives you
    global scan to hunt some rad rooms. If you struggle with micro,
    don't do this.
