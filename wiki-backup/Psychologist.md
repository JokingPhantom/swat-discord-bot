## Trainable Abilities

### [Mental Clarity](image:ability-clarity.gif "wikilink") [Mental Clarity](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#clarity)

[right](file:tooltip-mc.jpg "wikilink")

> This is a good skill to level up for early game use and late game use.
> During the early game, put as many point as you can into Mental
> Clarity (mc), while also putting enough points into nanites to keep
> yourself safe. Put the Mental Clarity on either the Solo, Boss Killer,
> Watchman, HO, Mav, or other classes that are level-dependent.
>
> `Switch to or a different hero when the target of clarity is well ahead in levels in order to maximize the utility of your focii for the team. Using mc on people who are behind in levels (usually through death) will help them get back into the game.`
>
> You can come back to putting points into Mental Clarity if you need
> your intelligence for healing, spamming Mind-slays, or have maxed
> confidence and nanites.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Confidence](file:ability-conf.gif "wikilink") [Confidence](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#conf)

[right](file:tooltip-confidence.jpg "wikilink")

> Make sure that this is on the Boss Killer and has as many points put
> into it as possible during boss encounters unless the Boss Killer hero
> is already receiving adrenaline. When not engaging bosses, this skill
> should be used on the Demo or the Pyrotechnician to help crowd
> control. Micro this skill around to the right person for the time.



----

### [Motivation](file:ability-motiv.gif "wikilink") [Motivation Motivation](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#motiv)

[right](file:tooltip-motivation.jpg "wikilink")

> Only 8 point are required to max this skill which is a simple
> commitment if you are willing to micro-manage your Focii.
> Micro-managing this focii means constantly paying attention to
> characters who are separated from the group or lagging behind and
> giving motivation to them in times of need.
>
> `A common Psychologist strategy for helping revive the party is to motivate themselves once a teamwipe has occurred, rush to the nearest ABM, buy revives, then go around raising people.`
>
> Moti can greatly increase the speed at which a solo can finish their
> job, especially if you compliment this with confidence and switch when
> they are shooting vs moving. An active psy can be well-felt by the
> solo.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Refined Rifle](file:ability-refrif.gif "wikilink") [Refined Rifle](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#refrif)

[right](file:Tooltip-refrif.jpg "wikilink")

> This skill is the only one a psychologist cannot respecialize out of;
> points committed here are permanently spent.

> Main use is in soloing to effectively kill rads faster or if the psy
> can afford to use a \[\[Mini-Droid_MkII\|Mini-Droid MkII\]\] as the
> effectiveness of the droid scales of this skill

> Refined Rifle is sometimes recommended once 16 or 24 points are put
> into focii and the rest into nanites. This should leave enough spare
> points to allow max the appropriate focii for the situation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Nanites](image:ability-nanites.gif "wikilink") [Nanites](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#nanites)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

>
> The Psychologist should not be taking that many hits from mob, so
> there is usually a low need to quickly level this skill until one of
> the focii have been maxed, after which you should max nanites as quick
> as you can.

> Psychologists are frequently expected to be the quartermaster and
> recall to lab. A comfortable amount of nanites will aid in the
> survival of this role, although mind rot will help as well
>

## Innate Abilities

### [Mind Slay](image:ability-mindslay.gif "wikilink") [Mind Slay](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#mindslay)

[right](file:tooltip-mindslay.jpg "wikilink")

> Mini-Bosses do not die from Mind Slay but are reduced by 80%. Slayed
> mini-bosses incur a penalty to Mind Slays cooldown, so is not
> recommended.

> Slaying bosses reduces their current health by 50%. Godzilla and
> Nemesis are resistant to mind-slay and only receives a 33% reduction
> in health. Slaying bosses incurs a large cooldown penalty.

> Charred Mutants do not incur a penalty and all lives are slain as
> well. This is a prime target for mind slay.

> Beasts that are slayed do not spawn Beastlings.

> Slayed commies cannot be revived.

> Don't use slay on bosses unless you are using an Flower Child Psy,
> otherwise you will spend a vast amount of your time waiting for
> cooldown. [Megazilla](Godzilla "wikilink") is generally considered an
> exception given his high difficulty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mind Rot](image:ability-mindrot.gif "wikilink") [Mind Rot](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#mindrot)

[right](file:tooltip-mindrot.jpg "wikilink")

> This skill affects zombies, dogs, mutants, and spiders.

> Blue dogs and STNTs are the most dangerous units that can be Mind
> Rotted. Try to use a damage-over-time ability on them so they run off
> and die (such as Freeze Ray or a pyro's rockets)



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Respecialize](image:ability-respec.gif "wikilink") [Respecialize](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#respec)

[right](file:tooltip-respecialize.jpg "wikilink")

> A great way to get levels quick early game with [Mental
> Clarity](Psychologist#Mental_Clarity "wikilink") and then switch to
> something that helps with survivability or crowd control for Nemesis
> or dangerous situations.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Clairvoyance](image:ability-aware.gif "wikilink") [Clairvoyance](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-psy.htm#aware)

[right](file:tooltip-awareness.jpg "wikilink")

> The psy retains awareness of his current location, even after moving
> on.

> Only one clairvoyance can be on the map at a time.

> Head injuries and death remove the clairvoyance.

> This is useful as an extra camera, especially if you know an
> approaching boss or Nemesis nuke would destroy the sniper's camera.

> This ability also has the Awareness skill so place this behind the
> group if you are being followed by Commies.

## Good Builds

*What trait, spec, and talent to use, as well as skill point builds.*

<u>Healing</u>

**Heavy/Healer/Triage/Hacking**

<u>Group Support</u>

**Heavy/Engineer/Leadership/Hacking**

-   The nice thing about the Psy is that he can Re-Specialize. Usually
    you would max Mental Clarity. After that its up to you. Using
    Re-Specialize, you can max another skill.
-   Rarely the leader will ask you to Re-Spec to Confidence after the
    second/third boss so that the primary crowd control can perform
    their job more efficiently.
-   After maxing one skill to lvl 16 it is a good idea to get a
    survivable amount of Nanites (10+), then max Motivation in case the
    solo needs to move faster, someone needs to make a lab run, a severe
    ankle hits someone in the back, rez sickness is slowing someone
    down, or the borg wants to dance the mob more effectively.
-   Before Nemesis spawns it is good to Re-Spec to just Confidence and
    put the rest of your points into Refined Rifle and make a Mini-Droid
    MKII.

## More Information

### Hints/Tips

-   Mentats taken or any green intelligence will count as 1/3 of a
    normal intelligence point when using the abilities "Mind Slay" and
    "Mind Rot". Flower Child is a good trait to be to take advantage to
    this because enough mentats are taken the psychologist can have more
    than +200 int allowing him to use the "Mind Slay" ability on a full
    HP boss twice or more before it reaches the team, only if you have
    vision of the boss of course. Additional intelligence after 150 will
    have a small diminishing return and still provides noticeable
    performance until 200+.

<!-- -->

-   Classes to put mental clarity on (in no particular order): Heavy
    Ordinance, Watchman, Group Sniper, Alice or Maverick. These classes
    highly skill point dependent

<!-- -->

-   Keep an eye on the solo. Sometimes a mind rot, mind slay or
    motivation is what the solo needs to stay aalaive.
-   Mind slays are more effective when used against non-bosses like
    ghoul or grotesque or even rad zombie. In addition keep a watch for
    super tnt zombie when playing NM. Mind rot them if they are too
    close to exploding in the group.
-   Keep a watch on the front lines as you go. If they are in trouble
    __don’t be afraid to re-specialize any time to get confidence__
    up or uses mind rot to slow the mob. In addition, when you have
    confidence on a pyro or somebody else and they are running due to
    whatever reason, put confidence into somebody with rifle or sniper
    to help cover the backs of those retreating. //Running people can’t
    shoot = waste of confidence.//
-   Use re-specialize to get a full motivation to help those with rez
    sickness to move faster, or mental clarity so that they can recover
    lost levels.
-   If for some reason you decide to mindslay a boss, use mentat and
    mental clarity to decrease the cool down of mindslay. In addition,
    when mindslaying commies, try to get those in critical health, this
    allows a quick cool down for repeated use.
-   Having the second highest (or highest with MC) intelligence, a psy
    should carry some bandages. Even more if he is a healer trait.
