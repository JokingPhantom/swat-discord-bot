### \*\*Trainable Skills\*\*

\>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-mirv.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-mirv.gif "wikilink")
[1](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#mirv%7CMIRV)\*\*====
\> [image:mirv.jpg](image:mirv.jpg "wikilink")

-   This ability lags when used for the first time.
-   Several things to note about Mirv are that it has an unusual travel
    time (quick, but not instant), and that it's secondary explosions
    don't trigger until around .5 - 1 second has passed after the
    ability has hit the ground for the first time.
-   This skill follows the Odd +2 skill efficiency progression.
-   MIRV progresses with a degree of randomness. It in no way aims at
    anyone.-Reduces Any unit's armor by 4 while being damaged by napalm
    (US, rads, boxes, bosses, anything with an armor type)
-   This skill proves very useful for keeping a pile of zombies down,
    clearing out rooms quickly, and firing at the mob while retreating.
-   Make sure you don't MIRV other players or dogs, as this can prove
    very easy to do.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\#c4](#c4 "wikilink") \>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-c4.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-c4.gif "wikilink")
[C4](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#c4%7CPlace)\*\*====
\> [image:c4.jpg](image:c4.jpg "wikilink")
[image:c3.jpg](image:c3.jpg "wikilink")

-   One of the most useful skills for slowing down and keeping down the
    mob. At higher levels your C4 will last ages before detonating while
    at the same time drawing in large amounts of enemies.
-   This skill proves most effective with a constantly moving party so
    that the zombies following the party will get stuck with C4 and
    either never reach the party, or suffer extreme damage before they
    do.
-   C4 proves to be an effective alternate way to cam rooms, and to
    destroy room-spawns. This should only be used however, if a cam is
    needed and you have tons of energy to spare, since C4 is always more
    effective when out in the open where it can attract greater amounts
    of enemies.
-   <span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Manual
    detonation makes low level C4 much more viable. Leave the AI off.
    Wait until it's about to get killed then hit C Z. The problem with
    the AI at that low level is the C4 cloaks before it explodes. The
    same is true when you hit manual detonate - it cloaks and you lose a
    lot of mob. Hitting cloak first toggles the cloak on and then when
    you hit detonate right after, the cloak gets turned back off again,
    meaning zombies don't stop attacking it. Also, once the detonate
    button is hit, C4 becomes explode on death, so you don't need to
    time it perfectly, you just need to get the order in before it
    actually dies. Using this trick (hitting CZ with no AI) makes lower
    level C4 MUCH more efficient.</span>
-   <span style="font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">At levels 13-16,
    C4 gains a placement range bonus and does extra damage as a
    percentage of its current energy.</span>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[\#gen](#gen "wikilink") \>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gen.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gen.gif "wikilink")
[Generator](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#gen%7CAdvanced)\*\*====
\> [image:gen.jpg](image:gen.jpg "wikilink")

-   A must-have for any type of Demo. This skill allows enough mana
    regeneration to spam MIRV and C4 as much as you will ever need.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-lockdown.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-lockdown.gif "wikilink")
[2](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#lockdown%7CLock-Down)\*\*====
\> [image:lock.jpg](image:lock.jpg "wikilink")

-   Because Lockdown temporarily removes the Demo's attack, this can be
    a great way to drop aggro when it is absolutely necessary. Mob
    prefers C4 even to a Demo without an attack. Because it stops your
    hero temporarily, be very judicious in your choice of Lockdown
    times.
-   Lockdown is best used when toward the back half of the group. You
    will have plenty of range on Bio-Chem while still permitting you to
    pick out your targets with relative safety.
-   While in Lock-Down at any level your attack rate is boosted by 45%.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-nanites.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-nanites.gif "wikilink")
[3](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#nanites%7CNanites)\*\*
\> [image:nans.jpg](image:nans.jpg "wikilink")

-   This skill should have a substantial amount of points invested in it
    if using a heavy armor Demo, due to the possibility of being called
    upon to tank for a period of time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \*\*Innates\*\*

[\#biochem](#biochem "wikilink") \>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-biochem.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-biochem.gif "wikilink")
[Energy](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#biochem%7CBioChemical)\*\*====
\> //Rapid nano-combustion of organic material instantly converts up to
50% of target's health into energy. Bosses and power armored units are
somewhat resistant.<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Efficiency doubled
when used on self. Range increased by 40 per level of Adv. Generator.
Base range quadrupled while locked down. </span>//

-   BioChem is capped by two things: You can't take more than half of a
    mob's current health. Nor can you take more health than is necessary
    to cause your energy to become full from the conversion. More free
    space means more damage inflicted.
-   Bosses and power armored units will use the same system in
    determining how much damage is dealt (i.e. the amount required to
    fill up your bar) but will only give the hero back 50% of that in
    energy. Thus, it is impossible to fill up your energy on a
    Boss/power armor.
-   The ability will fail (and not give a cooldown) if the energy gained
    will be less than 40 e.
-   Conversion ratio is 33-66% at rank 1 and increases to 66% at rank
    11.
-   It can never kill a unit. That is correct. It is first and foremost
    a mechanism for gaining energy, not causing damage.
-   This skill should be used on any boss you run into just for the sake
    of the extra energy. By having a higher energy capacity from either
    duo-cells or storage cells, you can increase the amount of energy
    gained by even more.

[\#gearmod](#gearmod "wikilink") \>

\*\*[Mod](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#gearmod%7CGear)\*\*====
\> //Improves the armor by 1, attack damage by 6-8% depending on gun
type, mana capacity by 125, when using the orange, green, purple circuit
board respectively.// \> //After using the ability, the game will check
for the first board in the target's inventory. If no board is found, it
will check the board in the Demo's inventory as well.// \> //It can fuse
multiple color boards on the same person in one use.//

-   This skill should be used as much as possible. However, it is not
    your responsibility to spend money or bring in the boards. Ask the
    quartermaster to bring in boards for you to use in gear modding.
-   Mods that should be handed out first are the attack (green board)
    mod to any snipers rifles, and the armor (orange board) and energy
    (purple board) mods to the tank, then attack (green boards) mods to
    any crowd control characters, and finally energy (purple boards) to
    everyone else.
-   Most games have enough money to triple-mod everyone.

[\#nuke](#nuke "wikilink") \>
====\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-nuke.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-nuke.gif "wikilink")
[4](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-demo.htm#nuke%7CMini-Nuke)\*\*====
\> //Launches a small nuclear missile which explodes when it reaches the
targeted location, inflicting massive damage in a huge radius. Frequent
nuking may significantly increase radiation levels.//

-   Nukes have a built in penalty to prevent spamming which is the
    \*\*[Fallout Meter](fallout "wikilink")\*\*. Knowledge of this
    fallout meter is essential to knowing your limits while nuking.
-   Nuking can be quite hard to get used to. Firstly it travels rather
    quickly, but it still has to travel, so you will have to guess where
    to target. Actually being able to see the target, or know where it
    will be helps immensely.
-   Do not nuke at the final parts of an Insane Perfect attempt, because
    if perfect conditions have been enforced you can ruin the attempt
    and only gain a regular Insane victory out of it by causing extra
    rads to spawn.
-   Nuked zombies always reanimate without taking off a life, but they
    will no longer have conditions like TNT, Flames, or Toxins. And any
    beasts, grotesques, dogs, etc you can catch in the blast are put
    down for good. Zombies now no longer revive with full life and now
    instead revive just as a normal zombie that had been killed revives
    with severely low hp. This allows more total experience in the game
    and zombies easier to kill.
-   Nightmare spawns an extra wave of zombies at the beginning. Landing
    a nuke at the close doorway of the graveyard at one minute can give
    an extra early level and make the first few waves much easier to
    kill.

\> //Toggles which type of smart mine automation is automatically
activated when placing C4. The choices are none, trickster, and
screamer. Trickster prefers not to detonate until it has acquired and
lured the most targets it can. Screamer won't waste time waiting for
optimum conditions; instead it detonates when a reasonable number of
targets have been acquired.//

-   The standard practice is to leave S.M.A on Trickster.
-   The better practice is to keep SMA off and manually detonate your
    C4.

### Good Builds

**Author: Valcrist77**

**MIRV Demo:**

**Build:**

Energizer, Energy Cells, Toughness, Heavy Armor

Engineer, Cybernetics, Toughness, Heavy Armor

**Skill Build:**

-   1 MIRV, 1 gen, rest nanites
-   16 gen, 10 nanites
-   4 MIRV
-   Save skill points until Nemesis fight for 16 MIRV and as many
    Nanites as possible

**C4 Demo:**

**Build:** Reckless, Energy Cells, Toughness, Heavy Armor

**Skill Build:**

-   1 MIRV, 1 gen, rest nanites
-   10 gen, 9 nanites
-   Get level 4 C4 right as you leave GY camping
-   4 MIRV, 16 gen
-   5/6 C4 as game progresses and mob hits harder
-   Save skill points until Nemesis fight for 16 MIRV and as many
    Nanites as possible

**Notes:**

-   Classic Demo build is centered around 16 MIRV, and as many
    gen/nanites points as possible.
-   Low level MIRV is perfect for Innards, any priority target, grouped
    up mob, and even single zombies that approach the group from bad
    angles.
-   High level MIRV napalm does high damage, persists for a long time,
    and is shaped like a long rectange. Position the group to funnel the
    mob through one path, and hit that path with MIRV to effectively
    hold back the mob.
-   C4 Demo takes Reckless for more skill points, and C4 needs around 6
    points throughout the game to be effective.
-   At level 4 C4, it does 500 damage and has max radius. Level 5/6 give
    it more armor to take more hits, which is quite helpful when dealing
    with Reactors, SRAD, and Blue Rad. Higher levels of C4 are an
    inefficient usage of skill points, as they delay the mob too much
    and reduce exp gain by a substantial margin, as zombies spend more
    time hitting C4 instead of dying.You can manually micro the C4, or
    leave it on Trickster AI. Properly microed C4 is more effective than
    the AI, but the AI does a passable job.
-   Avoid casting MIRV in areas where the tank will stand, as it reduces
    their armor.
-   Constant nukes as the fallout allows will get your team extra
    levels, and help kill priorities before they reach the group. Ask
    for vision abilities from your team to find out where to nuke
    (cameras, fireflies, clairevoyance, etc.)
-   Nuke can allow you to easily switch pathing directly into large mob
    by softening it up, before running through with the tank controlling
    aggro.
-   Duo cells are the most effective item, as they allow you to Bio chem
    high HP targets and give you substantial mana gain. Any mini-boss or
    non hero target is a great unit to bio chem for mana and damage.
-   Duped mfgs/mfg+s are also useful, if bio chem is too hard to use
    effectively off cooldown.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### More Information

//Use of C4// - C4 can be used to serve two general purposes: Dealing
damage to the mob at a distance and delaying the mob from reaching the
team. The typical strategy is to space the C4 in the middle of the
street, and this better accomplishes the first goal. As mob health gets
higher (as in late-full, full-house nightmares), placing 2 (or more if
needed) C4 in a spot will help ensure the damage you do will take a life
from the zombies instead of just letting them heal. This is also useful
at very low level of C4. In a given area, place your C4 in a line, but
in pairs. As the first C4 cloaks to explode, the mob will move towards
the third and fourth, then the second will explode with the first,
damaging the mob that is in transit.

If your aim is primarily to delay the mob, place the C4 along walls or
in corners. The same number of enemies will be attracted to it, but not
all of them will be able to reach it, reducing the damage the C4 will
take and thus increasing the time the mob will spend killing it.

Also, setting an AI but manually decloaking your C4 will make the mob
pick them up sooner. This lets you leave Trickster as a default but use
something more like Screamer in situation where you need it.

Another trick for those with superior micro skills involves ping-ponging
the mob between two nearby c4 using cloak. Placing them on opposite
sides of a wall can force the mob to spend a long time in transit
between the two, increasing their net life span.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hints/Tips

The way C4 AI works is this: The mine sits there cloaked. If (1) amount
of mob run within a certain radius (2) of it in a short enough amount
(about 4s) of time, it decloaks. The mine will self-detonate once its HP
drops below a certain amount (3), regardless of being cloaked or not. If
a boss comes within a certain radius , it WILL NOT(4) detonate.
Trickster mines will recloak if they don't sustain enough damage (5)
within a certain amount of time (about 12s) after auto-decloaking.

1\) This number increases as the demo's C4 skill level increases.
Trickster uses a higher number than screamer. 2) This radius is
dependent on the C4 outer blast radius and is the same for trickster and
screamer. 3) This number decreases as the demo's C4 skill level
increases. Trickster uses a lower number than screamer. 4) This was
added in v1.7.1, bosses ignore C4 completely (but do decloak them for
nearby enemies), and C4 ignore bosses. 5) This number is based on the
demo's C4 skill level.

The armor plating upgrade gives C4 damage reduction (like the mountain
giant has). I don't recall the specific numbers, but you can easily
witness how much tougher the mines get with C4 skill levels past 8.
