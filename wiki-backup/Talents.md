Every Swat Officer is given a random talent upon creation. These talents
are balanced to around 1/5 of a [Trait](Traits "wikilink") and is hidden
until Rank 9. Each Class has access to 4 out of 7 Talents.

Within the [RCPD](http://night.org/swat2/playerdb/) Build tool, Talents
can be unlocked to higher ranks by ranking up the classes that can
attain each Talent, and submitting those codes to RCPD. Courage is
unlocked to Rank 12 by default. To unlock Talents to 12 you must have
unlocked at least 3 Classes that can utilize that Talent unlocked to
Rank 12, regardless of the Talents that those specific codes have.

page](http://redscull.com/swat/readmeaftertalents.html) for more

## ![](Talent-courage.jpg "Talent-courage.jpg") Courage

*Gives a chance to gain an additional valor point each level-up.*

This is independent from the regular chance to gain valor on a level-up
and it is entirely possible to gain 3 valor per level from LSA Medal +
Courage + normal Level-up chances. Note: Medals are only active in
Extinction and solo Nightmare games, so the maximum valor points per
level in all cases except these is 2.

Although courage is available to any class, it will never be the random
talent that is generated with a new character. It can be generated onto
any class using the [Official RCPD Rank Code
Manager](http://night.org/swat2/playerdb/).

All Courage Officers share the same "chance pool", and every time a
valor point is awarded to any Courage player, the chance goes down by:
0.7% + 0.3% \* Player Count (1.0% to 3.4%). The initial pool is 43.7%.
The below table shows the maximum valor points that Courage can add to
the game (no matter how many players choose Courage.) Being some of the
% chances for the last few valor are fairly low however, you may not be
guaranteed this amount of valor.

| Player Count | Max Valor |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | 44        |
| 2            | 34        |
| 3            | 28        |
| 4            | 23        |
| 5            | 20        |
| 6            | 18        |
| 7            | 16        |
| 8            | 15        |
| 9            | 13        |

## ![](Talent-wiring.jpg "Talent-wiring.jpg") Wiring

*Increases energy regeneration by 14%, .84 eps.*

## ![](Talent-running.jpg "Talent-running.jpg") Running

*Movement speed is increased by 15.*

## ![](Talent-spotting.jpg "Talent-spotting.jpg") Spotting

*Increases sight range by 266.*

Bonus affects the Officer, [Prowler](Traits#Prowler "wikilink")'s
sensor, [Pyro](Pyrotechnician "wikilink")'s Firefly,
[Psy](Psychologist "wikilink")'s Clairvoyance, and
[Demo](Demolitions "wikilink")'s C4. Stacks with
[Awareness](Psychologist#Awareness "wikilink"),
[Prowler](Traits#Prowler "wikilink"),
[Marksmanship](Covert_Sniper#Marksmanship "wikilink"), and [Ocular
Enhancements](Watchman#Ocular_Enhancements "wikilink").

## ![](Talent-toughness.jpg "Talent-toughness.jpg") Toughness

*Increases health by 40 and armor by 1.*

## ![](Talent-tinkering.jpg "Talent-tinkering.jpg") Tinkering

*Intelligence is +3-4 for the purpose of determining item usability.*

[Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink") Class receives +4 int from Tinkering,
all other Classes that can equip Tinkering receive +3. Due to having low
Intelligence gain, Tinkering can be worth 9-10 levels of Int
progression, allowing them to use certain items earlier. Tinkering is
considered [black int](Intelligence "wikilink").

## ![](Talent-hacking.jpg "Talent-hacking.jpg") Hacking

*Allows you to auction items and confiscate credits from the black
market via your Lab. Locker.*

###### Auctioning Items

Using the Auction Item ability on an item in the hacker's locker is the
only way to sell items prior to powering ABMs. Items sold to ABMs are
worth exactly 50% of their original cost, but auctioned items are worth
a random value between 33% and 75% of their original cost (67% to 150%
of the sell price displayed on the item). So while you could get more
credits for auctioning an item instead of selling it at an ABM, it's
worth noting that the average auction, statistically, will return only
44% of the original cost (88% of selling price displayed on the item).
If the item you hacked returns more credits than its worth the message
telling you how much you earned ends with a '!' otherwise just a '.' .

Items with a sell price of \>1500 (ATME items and the first sold Assault
Droid parts) auction for a random value between 25% and 37.5% of their
original cost (50% to 75% of the selling price displayed on the item)
(Assuming 'original cost' would be 4000 credits if they were able to be
purchased). When you strategically auction one of these items early
instead of selling it to an ABM later, you're forfeiting 500-1000
credits.

###### Confiscating Credits

All hackers can confiscate credits from powered ABMs. Doing so requires
that their Officer stands near the ABM while the player uses the lab
locker's Hack Kiosk ability on that ABM (requires your Officer to be
alive). Every time you hack, you confiscate a random amount of credits
from the black market account which initially has 1600 credits. The
higher your [white + green intelligence](Intelligence "wikilink"), the
more credits you're likely to confiscate per hack, but in the end,
intelligence just means less total hacks required to get all the credits
out. On average, you'll have confiscated about 1200 credits after 3-5
hacks. Acquiring the remaining credits in the account could take several
additional hacks. Which ABM you use 'Hack Kiosk' on is irrelevant; you
can hack the same one repeatedly.

Every Hacking player in the game accesses the same black market account,
so it is possible to use just one player to hack all of the credits out
of it. Also, while the first hacking player adds 1600 credits to the
account, every additional hacker causes the account to be increased by
160 less credits (i.e. 1600 - 160(x-1)). Thus a team still benefits from
the 9th hacking player, but that 9th hacker only added 320 credits to
the account. It is probably not worth it to have more than a few hackers
in the game; the additional hackers could probably have made better use
out of alternate talents.
