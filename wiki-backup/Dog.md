align="left"](image:dogs.jpg_align="left" "wikilink") These aren't the
happy robodogs, these are wild dogs. And they're hungry. They aren't
that hard to take down but their speed and damage is strong enough to
make you not want to ignore them. Snipers need to be careful not to run
into one of these.

## Variants

[image:firedog.jpg width="115" height="86"
align="left"](image:firedog.jpg_width="115"_height="86"_align="left" "wikilink")
The //Fire Dog// gets a bonus +100 damage. Combine this with a very fast
attack speed making this dog pretty offensively strong. Don't let him
hit you long if at all.

[image:fumedog.jpg width="112" height="104"
align="left"](image:fumedog.jpg_width="112"_height="104"_align="left" "wikilink")
//Toxic Dogs// have glowing green poison fumes. They drop a poisonous
rat on death. These dogs make it hard to run away from but are often
times not able to be effective enough to make it to a camped group to
drop the rat.

[image:tntdog.jpg width="114" height="104"
align="left"](image:tntdog.jpg_width="114"_height="104"_align="left" "wikilink")
The //TNT Dog// dog glows a dark brown color but has no displayed tnt
barrel. When killed the dog explodes dealing tnt damage to nearby allied
and enemy units that goes through nanites. Their speed and small bodies
makes this deadly TNT unit often times hard to spot and kill quickly. In
large groups the splash fire usually destroys them but caught out in the
open these fast moving dogs can quickly damage your hero. The dog can be
either single or double tnt with no displayed difference.

[image:newblue.jpg width="113" height="87"
align="left"](image:newblue.jpg_width="113"_height="87"_align="left" "wikilink")//[\#bdBlue](#bd "wikilink")
Dogs// are a Nightmare miniboss variant. Blue Dogs that manage to attack
a player will release a chain lightning that damages nearby teammates
and utterly devastates anyone with low levels of nanites. They are
invisible until they attack, move even faster than normal dogs, have
high health and armor. Only one blue dog can possibly be on the map at a
time. Kiting or dancing blue dogs will let them get fewer hits in,
meaning less chain lightning that hits teammates. Because a lot of the
lethality of blue dogs comes from their move and attack speed, debuffing
will let the single-target dps take them down harmlessly. Easy ways to
slow them down include [Freeze Ray](Lab#freezeray "wikilink"),
[concussion grenade](sniper#conc "wikilink"), [Temporal
Distortion](watchman#gren "wikilink"), Plasma Rounds from a chaingun.
Their invisibility can often make it so they wind up IN the group before
anyone knows they are there. There are only three units that can see
invisible units: [Psychologists](Psychologist "wikilink"),
[Watchmen](watchman "wikilink") with max
[Oculars](Watchman#loadout "wikilink") and [Chrome
Retrievers](Robo#chrome "wikilink"). [C4](Demolitions#c4 "wikilink") and
[Claymore](Consumables#claymore "wikilink") can force the blue dog to
attack, breaking its cloak so at least the group knows that one is on
the map. Its cloak has a long cooldown, so laying a single claymore
every once in a while might reveal them long before they get to the
group. Their high hp makes them an excellent target for
[Biochem](Demolitions#biochem "wikilink"), because the max energy is not
reduced by boss status or Power Armor. Because of their high armor the
prime skills for taking these guys down include [Cluster
Rockets](cyborg#cluster "wikilink"),
[Microwave](Pyrotechnician#micro "wikilink") and [Mind
Slay](Psychologist#mindslay "wikilink") (only 80% effective). Incendiary
rocket and a mind rot together will easily dispose of a blue dog for
good.

## Notes

Dogs are faster than most zombies which makes them a priority target,
but have less health than normal zombies making them almost a waste for
snipers to shoot. A few assault rifles should aim at this target to
bring it down without taking the sniper's gaze of the high-health
threats. TNT dogs and Blue Dogs are very much worth the attention of the
sniper.
