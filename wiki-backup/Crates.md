*In rooms around the map, players will find boxes that contain items. It
is essential to find and utilize these items.*

Note that there are 8 types of crates in the game. Each type of crate
has its own "loot list" of what it can drop. All non-Chrono crates have
500 hp and no health regeneration and will spawn in random rooms
scattered across the map. There are four ways the crates may be arranged
in a given room:

-   All brown boxes: Room is either all Implants, or is full of Trait,
    Basic, and Advanced Consumables
-   All silver boxes: Room is full of Basic and Advanced Gear
-   Few silver, usually some brown as well: Contains the ATME or Fake
    ATME item in one silver crate. Other silver crates contain basic and
    advanced gear, brown crates contain implants.
-   Single crate in Park: Found in Extinction and Survival game modes.
    In Extinction a message will appear alerting the team that the
    [ChronoTech Corporation's](Chrono "wikilink") box has landed
    somewhere in the park. This crate has 2500 hp and high health
    regeneration. It can not be opened covertly. In Survival, the crate
    starts in the park at the beginning of the game. There is no message
    alerting the team.
