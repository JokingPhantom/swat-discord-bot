*This has a steep rise in difficulty from Normal Difficulty. It is aimed
to hone your skills to go from Noob to Decent.*

## Hints and Tips

-   Unlike Normal, this difficulty takes a little more time to beat when
    starting as a new player. Find a team of other decent members and
    maybe a ringer and you can get through it though. Due to its steep
    rise in difficulty from normal, it will quickly make you a better
    player.
-   Get a couple of levels before you start completing objectives.
-   Pay attention to reactors - they may begin to start blowing up, or
    activating the broken repair droid.
