## Trainable Abilities

### [Cluster Rockets](image:ability-cluster.gif "wikilink") [Cluster Rockets](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#cluster)

[right](file:tooltip-clusterrockets.jpg "wikilink")

-   Use the targeting circle to stun mobs off of allies without hitting
    them. Compensating for cast time means officers are usually on the
    very edge of the reticle.
-   This can be animation cancelled, making it useful for kiting.
-   While damage is split between all targets, the stun is constant.
-   Damage is armor-ignoring, making it an effective miniboss killer.
    Bosses (including Nemesis) take +50% extra damage from this ability.
-   The stun duration is not reduced on bosses and increases at level 6,
    11 and 16. These are breakpoints to aim for as you can integrate
    additional MFGs at these levels as well.
-   Use the stun to redirect Nemesis' attention when he is attacking
    another officer.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Xtreme Combat Mode](file:ability-xcm.gif "wikilink") [Xtreme Combat Mode](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#xcm)

[right](file:tooltip-xcm.jpg "wikilink")

-   Commonly leveled to 8 if main tank for its armor bonus.
-   The damage buff scales non-linearly above 8, meaning the 16th point
    is the most valuable one from a damage perspective.
-   Scales off of white damage, meaning it benefits from ammo.

The decision to level XCM or plasma-V rounds for a non-tanking cyborg
depends on multiple factors. Both are balanced at baseline 8-16 in XCM
increases damage by 31 while Plasma-V increases damage by 32. Eating
ammo, being gear-modded, using a PCC medal in Extinction/Solo Nightmare
or eating the Magnum Chronotech favor XCM. Temporal Avatar favors
Plasma-V. There are also utility factors to consider: survivability vs
slow.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Organic Replacement](file:ability-org.gif "wikilink") [Organic Replacement](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#org)

[right](file:tooltip-organic.jpg "wikilink")

-   This ability is mandatory for any cyborg who wishes to tank.
-   The evasion stacks multiplicatively with the evasion from both
    Acrobat as well as Aegis Vest. Total evasion can reach 70% with all
    bonuses.
-   The extra health this provides means the needs for healing can be
    postponed for longer, multiple TNTs can be tanked without dying.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Plasma-V Rounds](file:ability-plasrnd.gif "wikilink") [Plasma-V Rounds](http://www.redscull.com/swatclassinfo-cyborg.htm#plasrnd)

[right](file:tooltip-plasmarounds.jpg "wikilink")

-   The slow, both move speed and attack speed, is not reduced against
    bosses nor allied heroes.
-   Arguably the cyborg's weakest ability, points should only be
    invested here after XCM unless the cyborg will be using a Temporal
    Avatar (as the avatars scale off of weapon skill)



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Nanites](image:ability-nanites.gif "wikilink") [Nanites](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#nanites)

[right](file:Upgrade_-_Nanites.jpg "wikilink")

The Cyborg comes with [Advanced Armor](Armor#advanced "wikilink"),
giving him the energy efficiency of a Large nanites generator but having
a base 230 [movespeed](Move_Speed "wikilink") instead of 220. Advanced
Armor users cannot sprint and do not have access to other armor types.

-   Given the Cyborg's lack of sprint, he must rely on his nanites to
    get him out of situations more than the average hero.
-   Although these are frequently maxed because cyborgs are called upon
    to tank, even non-tanking cyborgs need a healthy level of nanites to
    compensate for a lack of sprint. If Goliath Modification is not used
    common breakpoints are: levels 10, 14 or 19 to reach higher
    absorption percentages.

## Innate Abilities

### [Pheromones](image:ability-phero.gif "wikilink") [Pheromones](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#phero)

[rightThis](file:tooltip-phero.jpg "wikilink") ability is very useful
for many situations:

1.  Pushing through mob to reach an objective
2.  Saving a weak member of the party from an attack or miniboss (ie. a
    hyper ghoul or double tnt)
3.  Clearing a corpse so the officer can be revived
4.  Repositioning while tanking a boss without losing aggro
5.  Resetting an atomic zombie's aggro, allowing a more suitable unit
    (an alice or a rad-resistant hero) to tank it's punch

Of note:

-   Does not work on power armored enemies, innards, or repair droids.
-   Remember to refill pheromones when there is energy to spare.
-   Super Mutants' smash and Horrors' Rad Bolt assign new orders, so you
    should try to save phero to counteract these abilities.
-   You can release pheromones even when the recharge ability is still
    on cooldown or even while stunned!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Emergency Power](image:item-battery.jpg "wikilink") [Emergency Power](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#backbat)

[right](file:tooltip-chargebatt.jpg "wikilink")

-   This ability's cooldown improves over the course of the game.
-   Use this as often as possible to preserve real batteries for
    Nemesis.
-   This ability may cause you to lose boss aggro, as you briefly stop
    shooting. To prevent this (and more importantly, to prevent bosses
    stepping onto you causing allied splash) immediately right click the
    boss after using to cancel the animation and resume shooting.
-   This ability is particularly useful for Nemesis' "wimps" phase on
    Extinction as you do not need to bring in locker batteries or pick
    any up from the ground.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Goliath Modification](image:ability-repairsys.gif "wikilink") [Goliath Modification](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#repairsys)

[right](file:tooltip-goliath.jpg "wikilink")

*Integrates a [Shield Capacitor](Shield_Capacitor "wikilink")*

-   The shield capacitor must be on the ground to use.
-   Allows the cyborg to use a shield capacitor without the required 120
    intelligence.
-   Integrating a shield capacitor will slow movement speed by 20
    regardless of the Power Armor Specialization.
-   Integrating a shield capacitor will drop Shield Cap Parts. These can
    be used to remake another shield capacitor by combining 2x
    Micro-Fusion Generators and three Circuit Boards (one of each
    color). This is a minor cost savings (1360 vs 1500) but allows a
    second shield capacitor to be acquired before 44 minutes.

Holding the shield capacitor instead of integrating it will provide
energy cap as well as a slightly higher movement speed with the Power
Armor Specialization but takes up an inventory slot and requires
intelligence. Receiving a head injury below 120 intelligence from a
Super Mutant punch may also cause nanites to bug and turn off. The
benefits of holding the first shield capacitor rarely outweigh its
risks. One of the few times this is acceptable is with the engineer
specialization, as the Shield Capacitor can be used much earlier (113
int) and then replicated and eaten.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Force Field](image:ability-ff.gif "wikilink") [Force Field](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#ff)

[right](file:tooltip-forcefield.jpg "wikilink")

*For advanced information on Force Field, see the following [Forum
Post](http://redscull.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=2263)*

`In Summary`
`  1) Merely activating force field causes a permanent penalty equivalent to as much as 40 seconds of use; each activation increases the base energy use by 4 (increases P by 0.08). `
`  2) While in use, the energy drain increases linearly per second based on your hidden P value. `
`  3) After the force field is off, you will incur a slight permanent penalty per every 5th second you left it on. (increases P by 0.01, which is 0.5 energy to the base cost)`
` `
`So to minimize force field costs, this may very well already be obvious, but `
`  1) Try not to activate force field too many times overall. If all you do is incur the activation penalty, the 22nd time you use force field will drain more than 100 energy per second, which is about when it gets cost prohibitive. `
`  2) Try not to leave force field on too long; try to turn it off before the seconds reach multiples of 5 so you don't get another permanent penalty.  Turning force field immediately off after you turn it on is exactly the same as leaving it on for 4 seconds before flipping it off; both do not incur further penalty past the activation penalty. Similarly, leaving it on for 6 seconds is the same as leaving it on for 9 seconds in terms of permanent penalties. `

-   You can still die to toxins with Force Field on
-   Energy drain scales with difficulty; it is more efficient in
    nightmare and extinction difficulties.
-   Be prudent in your use of the ability and when used ensure the
    danger has passed before deactivating.

### [Vindicator](image:ability-wvind.gif "wikilink") [Vindicator](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-cyborg.htm#wvind)

[right](file:tooltip-vindicator.jpg "wikilink")

-   The Vindicator is slightly stronger against mutants but weaker
    against innards than the standard chain gun given its higher damage
    but slower speed.

## Good Builds

### Tank

*The recommended way to play Cyborg.*

*Suggested Traits*:

*Suggested Specs*: ,

*Suggested Talents*: ,

-   1 point into Cluster Rockets, rest into Nanites until maxed

<!-- -->

-   Organic Replacements to 8
-   Cluster Rockets to 6 or 11\*
-   XCM to 8\*

<!-- -->

-   Max Cluster Rockets to eat additional MFGs

\**Levels in XCM or cluster rockets are interchangeable depending on the
need. If healing is weak or MFGs are rare, then leveling XCM first is
preferred.*

**Advantages**: Arguably the best boss tank in the game, highest
mitigation

**Disadvantages**: Limited crowd-control, item dependent compared to
other tanks, dancing mob is very energy intensive, high base hp can
cause aggro issues

### Crowd Control/Short Scout

*Suggested Traits*: , , ,

*Suggested Specs*: ,

*Suggested Talents*:

Between specs and traits you need to obtain enough intelligence to use
Stim Packs. For example Dragoon/Weaponry is a poor choice compared to
Chem Reliant/Weaponry or Dragoon/Chemistry.

-   1 point into Cluster Rockets, 1 point into PVR, 10 points into
    Nanites
-   XCM to 16, Cluster Rockets to 6, Nanites to 14
-   PVR to 16
-   Max Nanites

**Advantages**: High mobility, emergency backup tank, ability to stun
enemies, high intelligence

**Disadvantages**: Low range, poor priority control, poor innard
control, ammo and item dependent
