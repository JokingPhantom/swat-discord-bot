fight enemy heros like yourself!// Umbrella Marines are a strong
squadron of units like your main heros that come in rarely via streets,
not buildings. Mobs will not attack them and the marines can actually
buff the zombies! They are quite powerful in that they all have ranged
attacks that shoot over zombie "tanks" making it hard to attack them.
Throughout the game they upgrade in numbers spawned, attack speed
bonuses, movement speed bonuses, and upgraded nanites and skills.

## Skills

SWAT hero's skills but the not identical.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Variants

[image:rocktumb.jpg
align="left"](image:rocktumb.jpg_align="left" "wikilink")//Rocket
Umbrellas// have massive splash damage (which also hurts zombies) but
are not a significant threat due to the reduced damage power armor takes
from rockets. They have the Pep-Talk skill to buff the group and zombies
near him. Of the Umbrella variants he is probably the last one needed to
take out.

[image:a_umb.jpg
align="left"](image:a_umb.jpg_align="left" "wikilink")//Rifle
Umbrellas// have minor splash damage (which also hurts zombies) and are
fairly potent against Power Armor units. They have the Nano Inject skill
and should be taken out early to prevent them healing each other.

[image:newumb.jpg
align="left"](image:newumb.jpg_align="left" "wikilink")//Sniper
Umbrellas// do not splash, but deal very high individual damage.
Combined with their Critical Shot skill, Sniper Umbrellas are very
powerful offensive units and should be of high priority to kill early
on.

//Laser Rifle Umbrellas// (OH SNAP!) [\#wumb](#wumb "wikilink") These
umbrellas use the most damaging weapon against power armored units, the
laser rifle. They also have a more advanced stealth generator capable of
cloaking the unit even between shots or permanently during late-game. He
is of absolute highest priority to take out of all umbrellas. Only one
can be on the map at a time. Make him visible by using at least a level
8 concussion grenade, psychologist's awareness, prowler's special
ability, or chrome's true sight. Kill them with Mind Slay or Lethality
grenades or massive AoE damage. Watchmen with lethality should look for
the origin of the enemy laser to find where to target their grenade.
Laser umbrellas will usually survive a nuke. Large groups of umbrellas
often have a laser rifle umbrella ('wumb") which is invisible. In
extinction they channel group force field on the rest of the umbrella
squad and can protect the entire group from a nuke while naturally
surviving himself. Use of mind slay to kill him or cluster rockets to
hope to stun him (cancelling his channeled group force field) will allow
demo's mini-nuke to destroy the large group.

## Notes

-   The [Watchman](Watchman "wikilink") and both variants of his
    [laser](Weapons#laser "wikilink") weaponry are effective against the
    Umbrella Soldiers since they ignore evasion and do not get reduced
    by power armor. Pair this with attack speed buffs such as
    [adrenaline](Medic#adren "wikilink") makes for a powerful anti-umb
    tool.
-   The [Mini Droid MK II](Mini#mini2 "wikilink") is also quite
    efficient at dealing with Umbrella Soldiers.
-   The Watchman's [X grenade](Watchman#gren "wikilink") upgrade
    lethality will cause damage which is equal to half the bonus damage,
    which ignores nanites and armor.
-   The best way to deal with Umbrella Soldiers is to use the
    [Demolitions](Demolitions "wikilink")'s
    [mini-nuke](Demolitions#nuke "wikilink"). Be sure to inform the team
    of where you are nuking so that they can back up as appropriate. If
    you do use nuke to defeat umbrellas, you should do so as soon as you
    see them to limit the damage they do to the team.
