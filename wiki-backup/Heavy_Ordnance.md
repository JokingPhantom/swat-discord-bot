[Shield](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-hvyord.htm#plasshield%7CPlasma)\*\*====
\> [image:psheild.jpg](image:psheild.jpg "wikilink")

-   This skill does not become mana cost effective until nanites have
    been maxed. Thus, no points should be put into this until after
    nanites have been maxed.
-   Only 8 skill points required to max this skill making it an easy
    commitment.
-   This skill should only be activated when you are engaging bosses or
    excessive amounts of mob, or if you have full energy and high enough
    regeneration to counteract the mana degeneration.
-   Plasma shield does damage to innards.

[\#cellsdroids](#cellsdroids "wikilink") \> ====\*\*Cells and

[\#cell](#cell "wikilink")\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-cell.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-cell.gif "wikilink")
[Cells](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-hvyord.htm#cell%7CStorage)\*\*
\>\> //Increases the unit's maximum energy storage capacity and the
initial energy of his mini-droids. Also increases energy regeneration
while current energy is less than 1000.// \>\> //Each point increases
capacity by 250, initial mini-droid energy by 25 and regeneration by
16%. (max 8 points)//

-   -   This is a very useful skill when it comes to increasing the time
        that you can tank. Up to eight points can be invested in the
        Storage Cells part of Cells and droids, netting you 2000 extra
        mana capacity.
    -   This skill also has the benefit of increasing you droids mana
        capacity, which, if you keep your droids energy filled, will
        prove useful when filling Tors.

[\#ars](#ars "wikilink")\*\*[image:<http://www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-ars.gif>](image:http:/www.redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-ars.gif "wikilink")
[Integrity](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-hvyord.htm#ars%7CDroid)\*\*
\>\> //Upgrades your droids' automated repair system and increases their
structural integrity.//

-   -   //Each point increases droid vitality by 100, damage reduction
        by 4%, and armor by 2 (max 3 points)//
    -   The droid begins with .10 hps and then becomes 1 hps, 2 hps, and
        3 hps respectively per level.
    -   This skill proves useful for avoiding the situation of having to
        destroy your droids when they get to low on health and draw too
        much aggro.
    -   Since the only way to repair your droid is via the Tech Ops,
        Friendly Repair Bot, or its very low healing rate, this is a
        very viable alternative. [\#droido](#droido "wikilink")

\>\> //Upgrades your droids' damage and attack range// \>\> //Each point
increases ammunition level by 1 and range by 75. (max 4 points)//

-   -   This skill is very useful when you pair it with XLR8 and some
        levels in plasma rounds. Upgrading droid ammo directly helps
        increase your dps and aids the party when they hold position.
        Droid ammo also proves to be a powerful option when the droid
        are phased and can be pushed forward to deal with Umbrella
        Soldiers or mobs. [\#turbo](#turbo "wikilink")

\>\> //Increases your droids' movement speed.// \>\> //Increases
movement speed by 30. (max 1 point)//

-   -   This skill is very useful if you plan to use your droids to
        scout the map and clear rads. The ability to move quickly around
        the map can be very beneficial to the party.
    -   A fun alternative to using the Mecha to draw aggro is to shoot a
        Droid down to low health and give him a mobility upgrade to
        dance the mob.

[\#gen](#gen "wikilink") \>
====\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-reactor.gif>](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-reactor.gif "wikilink")
[Grid](http://redscull.com/swat/classinfo-hvyord.htm#reactor%7CPower)\*\*====
\> //Allows the officer to siphon energy from the city's power grid for
up to 20 seconds.// \> //Each point increases energy regeneration and
decreases cooldown by about 13%.// \> //Regeneration is halved until
partial power is restored.//

-   Replacement for Advanced Generator. Very useful skill for recovering
    lost energy after constructing a droid or tanking.
-   The officer does loose aggro while using this skill and must remain
    stationary.
-   Be wary of using this skill while anyone is filling a
    [Reactor](City_Power "wikilink"), if the Reactor pops it will drain
    the Heavy Ordnance of all his energy. If the HO is carrying a
    battery it will be used before tor pop damage is applied (if HO is
    within tor pop range).
-   Max level power grid can be "broken" right after the visual effect
    reaches the HO and still give \~300 energy without severely slowing
    the HO and with a very low cooldown.

\> [image:prounds.jpg](image:prounds.jpg "wikilink")

-   Has a shorter duration on bosses, but with
    [XLR8](HO#xlr8 "wikilink") activated it can be kept permanently on
    bosses. Not advised to get high levels unless you have an ample
    supply of energy regeneration.
-   While higher levels do cost a significant amount of energy per shot,
    slowing the attack speed of the boss can help the tank survive
    longer fights, especially on longer Nemesis fights.

\> [image:nans.jpg](image:nans.jpg "wikilink")

-   No matter what type of HO you are, maxing nanites is very important.
    Even if you aren't a tank, you could be called upon to be one
    because of you high energy stores and Plasma Shield. Your [Mini
    Droids](HO#droid "wikilink") have the same level of nanites as your
    hero.

\[[Droid](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-hvyord.htm#droid%7CConstruct)
\]\*\*==== \> //Created by Heavy Ordnances, [miniature assault
droids](Mini "wikilink") are strong support units. They are initialized
to half their creator's hero and ability levels and 200 energy. Their
base movement speed is set to their creator's base movement speed.//

-   Droids are one of the most useful expendable units in the game. They
    serve a variety of uses when it comes to supporting the party. They
    can (and should almost always) be used to scout rooms and kill rads,
    or fill Tors with their energy, or serve as a meat shield to delay
    the mob if the party is running away.
-   Using droids to scout requires effective micro-management skills and
    that a portion of your attention is constantly keeping watch over
    the droids as they scout rooms.
-   Using droids to fill Tors is as simple as beaming energy from other
    heroes with high energy regen until the droids mana is filled
    (though you should always ask for permission first), and then using
    the droids to fill a Tor.
-   Using droids as a meatshield requires a party that is running away
    from the boss or mob. All that you need to do is spawn a droid,
    continue running, and order the droid to engage the enemy so that
    the enemy spends a portion of their time either chasing after (if
    the droids have sufficient move speed to do this effectively, Plasma
    Rounds on the droid is also slightly useful for slowing the progress
    of the mob or boss) or just stopping to attack the droids.
-   At level 51 to 55 a Heavy Ordnance's droids Nanites get one level
    higher and 20 more health.

\> //Incrementally increases attack speed by accelerating the main
firing mechanism, but also generates excess heat. Moving cancels the
effect. Cooldown is determined by duration and rank.//

-   Mini droids adjacent to your hero while using XLR8 will gain an
    attack speed increase during the duration of XLR8 equal to the
    current attack speed of the HO, which is good for crowd control and
    bosses.
-   Should be used whenever camping or Crowd Controlling

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\> //[image:official.gifWritten](image:official.gif "wikilink") by
[redscull](redscull "wikilink") on forum on Thu Oct 19, 2006 (updated
for 1.10)// \> This is the part of the XLR8 code that determines the
cooldown:

\|\| Code: \>\> local integer i = 40 \>\> local integer h = 0 \>\> loop
\>\> call PolledWait(3.0) \>\> set h = h + 3 + 3\*RedDiv(123-i\*3, 20)
\>\> set i = i - 1 \>\> //(loop exits when i is 0, the player moved, or
the player died)// \>\> endloop \>\> set r = RedRankBracket(iP) \>\>
//(rank brackets are 1-5, corresponding to ranks 1-3, 4-6, 7-9, 10-11,
12)// \>\> if r == 1 then \>\> set h = Round(I2R(h)/1.5356) \>\> elseif
r == 2 then \>\> set h = Round(I2R(h)/2.1070) \>\> elseif r == 3 then
\>\> set h = Round(I2R(h)/2.9226) \>\> else \>\> set h =
Round(I2R(h)/3.9391) \>\> endif \>\> call RedWait(h+5) \|\|

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\> As you can see, there are four formulas used for determining the
cooldown. You have your initial formula that is then improved at ranks
4, 7, and 10. Each cooldown formula uses the length of time the chaingun
was XLR8ing to calculate how long it takes to cool down. Each 3 seconds
of operation increases the total cooldown more than the last 3 seconds
of operation (if you disregard the 5s penalty just for turning it on).

\> Here's a few examples: \> Rank 10 XLR8s for 120 seconds (when
chaingun overheats). Cooldown: 114.9 seconds \> Rank 10 XLR8s for 60
seconds. Cooldown: 37.0 seconds \> Rank 10 XLR8s for 28 seconds (when
+400% kicks in). Cooldown: 15.7 seconds \> Rank 10 XLR8s less than 3
seconds. Cooldown: 5.7 seconds

\> Rank 9 XLR8s for 120 seconds (when chaingun overheats). Cooldown:
152.8 seconds \> Rank 9 XLR8s for 60 seconds. Cooldown: 48.1 seconds \>
Rank 9 XLR8s for 28 seconds (when +400% kicks in). Cooldown: 19.4
seconds \> Rank 9 XLR8s less than 3 seconds. Cooldown: 6.1 seconds

\> Rank 6 XLR8s for 120 seconds (when chaingun overheats). Cooldown:
207.7 seconds \> Rank 6 XLR8s for 60 seconds. Cooldown: 64.81 seconds \>
Rank 6 XLR8s for 28 seconds (when +400% kicks in). Cooldown: 24.9
seconds \> Rank 6 XLR8s less than 3 seconds. Cooldown: 6.4 seconds

\> Rank 1 XLR8s for 120 seconds (when chaingun overheats). Cooldown:
281.4 seconds \> Rank 1 XLR8s for 60 seconds. Cooldown: 87.1 seconds \>
Rank 1 XLR8s for 28 seconds (when +400% kicks in). Cooldown: 32.4
seconds \> Rank 1 XLR8s less than 3 seconds. Cooldown: 6.9 seconds

\> Taking into account the attack speed boost and the cooldown, you get
the absolute best DPS out of XLR8 by leaving it on until it overheats.
However, this only applies if you manage your battles such that you're
actually slaughtering mobs that whole time you're XLR8ing. If you leave
it on until it overheats but had a reasonable period of time in the
middle where there were no mobs coming into your fire range, you'd have
been better off turning off XLR8 and turning it back on once the fight
started again.

Maximum capacity is 4 charges. (5 if trait is Gadgeteer.) If the Heavy
Ord uses a battery it allows him to recharge one additional battery
before corroding.//

-   This skill should be taken advantage of as much as possible whenever
    you have energy to spare. If you have energy to spare and no
    batteries to fill, demand them whenever you can.
-   If a Heavy Ord uses a battery on accident (or otherwise) it allows
    him to charge an extra battery before corroding. This is very useful
    for those times you need to make another mini but are just a little
    shy of the mana to make one.

\> //Activates a phase-shifter on your nearby mini-droids which prevents
them from being targeted or taking damage.// \> //A channeling ability
that lasts up to 20 seconds.// \> //Performing any action cancels the
effect.//

-   This ability helps to preserve your mini droids while letting them
    still deal large amounts of damage.
-   If XLR8 is activated, any mini-droids phased by the skill will gain
    XLR8 in a radius of 900, the same radius as the Phase Droids
    ability.
-   Droids can leave the 900 radius and retain their phase. Droids
    entering the 900 radius will not gain phase.
-   Phased droids provide the armor bonus to the HO as if they were
    standing next to the HO.

### More Information

With defense matrix ability of mini-droids, they give HO up to 12 extra
armor.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Hints/Tips

Best way to use a HO's droids is to stop the HO in a position then make
his droid surround him so that they can concentrate their fire and kill
zombies fast due to the splash damage of the chaingun. If you use this
tactic be sure to have Plasma rounds on your HO so he slows zombies down
so you can kill them. This tactic can also be used to tank bosses droids
up in front of the HO then the HO using XLR8 plus Plasma Rounds to kill
a boss pretty quickly.

### Guides

### DPS Group HO:

Author: Valcrist77

**Build:** Swift Learner/Robotics/Toughness

Reckless/Robotics/Toughness

-   1 cell/1 grid, save points for 4 ammo/4 grid (need 1250e cap for 3rd
    mini after 1st power grid)
-   8 grid (45cd, 73eps)
-   4 cells
-   10 Nanites
-   Spec into late game as necessary - grid for more battery filling,
    nanites to be a little tankier, and plasma rounds when you can start
    supporting the energy drain via grid. You won't need plasma rounds
    until you corrode your battery charger, which is around 20-30
    minutes.
-   Late game: Max plasma rounds, 4 cells/4 ammo, max power grid, 14
    nanite points if reckless, otherwise max nanites. Dump excess points
    into droid movespeed, cells, and droid integrity.

Notes:

-   If off tanking, max nans and plasma shield before plasma rounds.
-   Get a skill point early. Life extension at Nemesis is a good use of
    left over valor.

Guide:

1.  At the start, build 2 minis if not rushing a reactor or filling an
    early battery.
2.  Build minis whenever not filling batteries.
3.  Rush filling batteries with all excess energy, even after corroding
    the battery charger.
4.  Maintain 5 minis with energy when you have spare energy after
    corroding your battery charger.
5.  Be sure to get skill point from lab whenever possible.
6.  When filling tors, fill with your hero early, and XLR8 at the
    entrance. Phase your minis when they enter the reactor to fill.
7.  When using XLR8, try to position yourself behind a boss, and 1200
    range away from the nearest corner the mob is coming from.
8.  During Nemesis, break your XLR8 whenever Nemesis teleports away, and
    reset to another position to XLR8. If Nemesis's position when he
    arrives forces you to reposition, do it quickly.
9.  Issue attack orders on Nemesis to avoid splashing allies
    accidentally. Shift queue attack orders if you need to engage
    multiple targets. Make sure to kill Commandos evenly, so they do not
    rez each other.
10. Be careful about splashing when your allies are repositioning - you
    can issue a move command on an allied unit to hold fire.
11. Target fire the middle of mob to maximize crowd control.
12. XLR8'ed phased minis are one of the best ways to destroy enemy mini
    droids and spider mines, due to their invulnerability, high DPS, and
    available attention span. Other classes with anti spider mine
    abilities will often be distracted with other responsibilities like
    off tanking, healing, etc, so the prime responsibility of calling
    out and destroying mini droids should fall on the GHO if available.

### Solo HO:

Author: Valcrist77

**Build:** Reckless/Espionage/Running

-   Level 1: 1 cell/1 grid, Nanites off, save points for ammo/cells/grid
    (need 1250e cap for 3rd mini after 1st power grid)
-   Level 5: 4 ammo/5 grid
-   Level 6: 1 droid mobility/6 grid (mobility for scouting power and
    faster XLR8 phase usage)
-   Level 8: 3 cells/8 grid (45cd, 73eps)
-   Level 9: 4 cells
-   Level 16: 12 Nanites points (91%, 1.25 hero 10, or 91%, 1.10 hero
    with moh 11) (91%, .60 mini 12), 9 grid
-   Level 20: 14 Grid (20cd, 94eps), 1 Plasma Rounds
-   Level 32: 13 Plasma Rounds (+44dmg/4e)
-   Level 34: 14 Nanites (91%, .95 hero 12, or 91%, .80 hero with
    moh 13) (92%, .40 mini 14)
-   Level 36: 16 Grid (15cd, 100eps)
-   Level 39: 16 Plasma Rounds (+50dmg/4e)
-   Dump excess points into droid durability and cells
-   You can get 1 skill point and 1 promotion, to finish at level 37.

Notes:

-   You can skimp on nanites early game if you have the micro and low
    delay, but nanites are a good use by nemesis due to splash
    possibilities and increased value of unphased minis due to tech ops
    auras.
-   You can solo fill badly reactors in nightmare (4 hero beams, 5
    droid), fill hero beams with 4 adjacent minis for armor bonus in
    case of pop, then grid/phase outside to tank/sprint away from repair
    droid. You can fill with batts as well, and no penalty before
    corrosion
-   You can solo fill damaged reactors in extinction
-   Get a skill point early. Life extension at Nemesis is a good use of
    left over valor.

Guide:

1.  At the start, build mini \#1, grid, then mini \#2 and \#3. Scout in
    different directions to maximize room clear speed
2.  Direct hero to item rooms of good value, and use XLR8 on rad
    rooms/red rads/blue rad/large item rooms
3.  Be more conservative with scouting at 11 and 18/21 minutes, AKA when
    room/priorities spawn, and keep minis/heroes within same quadrant.
4.  After delivering priority items (2nd LAD, regen for duping, RR3/2/1,
    ammos for 1st/2nd LAD), you should drop off far away items at
    Reactors/ABMs/APCs/ in the group's path. Moving everything to the
    lab directly is usually too slow.
5.  Use Buffouts or Mentats+Bandages to keep HP high from
    radiation/hazmat running.
6.  Use 1 Mentat+Stim pack to run fast when delivering items/selling
    Hazmats.
7.  After the city power is re-established (3 reactors filled), use the
    lab scan off cooldown to find rads in already explored rooms. Use a
    screenshot to keep record.
8.  Corrode battery charger ASAP. Camp lab batts after 8 grid or ABM
    batts, with max gold priority, as long as you can fill them to 4
    batts. Aim for 20-25 minute corrosion.
9.  Keep mini in 1 block distance or closer of hero after 20 minutes, or
    early game when boss spawns are too close/have not been seen by
    group.
10. Keep 1 mini in operating distance of graveyard, and attempt to spawn
    it every 4 minutes or so.
11. Be prepared to XLR8 for SRAD after 30 minutes, depending on group
    status.
12. Finish hazmats, assist reactor fills if close by.
13. Remake minis before Nemesis spawns
14. If tech ops is in game, maximize unphased mini adjacent XLR8 time to
    obtain max damage bonus.
15. Use phase when Nemesis appears and direct minis away from group. You
    can unphase when the EMP stun has been thrown. Phase to dodge EMP
    stun on minis.
16. Phase before wimps occurs.

(x/8/15/16) (8 cells/4 ammo/3 Integrity) get nanites between 9 and 16.
keep cells at or below 4 until you max power grid. Then max your
nanites, cells, and droid ammo. Then max plasma shield. Finally, put
some points into Droid Integrity. any excess points can go into plasma
rounds or droid mobility.

__Skill Information__ Equation for mini plasma rounds: (.75\*plasma
rounds) + (.5\*plasma shield) = Value After you attain "Value", truncate
the decimal. The value you get will be your mini's plasma round level.
Storage Cells - Every even point increases the storage capacity of your
minis by 250. Power Grid - If you do not get two points into Power Grid
you won't be able to drain with your minis. Every even point upgrades
drain on your minis. At level 16 Power Grid has a 20 second duration and
a 15 second cooldown. When two tors are up, this skill becomes more
efficient. Phased Droids - The radius on XLR8 increases when you use
phase. Phased droids do not get auras. You can queue phased droids on
top of itself using the shift key. Droid Integrity, Droid Ammo, and
Droid Mobility are the only skills that are immediately effective on
your minis.

__Responsibilities__ Mini scout - Try to send a mini out of the
bunker to scout. If you keep your mini on the outer edge of the map you
should be able to avoid spawns. If your lucky you can cover the entire
outer edge of the map! Mini army - Mid-Late game, you should have 3-5
minis ready to help fill reactors. constantly rebuild your lowest level
mini. XLR8 - try to XLR8 every chance you get. Power Grid - If you can,
XLR8 before using power grid. Recharge batteries - Ask the Quarter
Master to drop 1 stacks in the lab. Then ask the sniper to teleport
them. keep charging even if you are corroded.
