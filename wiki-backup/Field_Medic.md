## Trainable Abilities

### [Nano-Injection](image:ability-nanoinj.gif "wikilink") [Nano-Injection](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#nanoinj)

[right](file:tooltip-nano.jpg "wikilink")

> Get to around levels 7-12 for effective quick heals and injury
> removal.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mend Wounds](file:ability-mend.gif "wikilink") [Mend Wounds](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#mend)

[right](file:tooltip-mend.jpg "wikilink")

> Put at least 4 skill points into this to create cost effective mending
> stations. This skill should be your primary mode of healing

> Watch out that you don't leave this skill on auto-cast, as this will
> leave you always healing the most minute amounts of health for your
> comrades and sometimes accidentally running over to them through the
> mob to heal them.

> This skill is necessary for effective use of the mender which is the
> best way for the medic to heal the party efficiently.

[right](file:tooltip-junkie.jpg "wikilink")

> When fully leveled, this guarantees adrenaline rush on the Medic in
> addition to the target hero. The utility of this skill is greatly
> improved by points in Refined Rifle, higher ammo levels and anything
> that gives the Medic additional damage.

[right](file:tooltip-refrif.jpg "wikilink")

> Because this skill synergizes so well with Adrenaline Junkie, it is
> wise to level this skill in conjunction with the other.

> If using a CC medic, this will be your primary means of increasing
> your dps and it synergizes well with adrenaline. (see note at bottom
> of page)

## Innate Abilities

### [Adrenaline](image:ability-adren.gif "wikilink") [Adrenaline](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#adren)

[right](file:tooltip-adrenaline.jpg "wikilink")

> Adrenaline lasts 20 seconds when used on a unit. But if enough total
> enemy kills occur during the last 5 seconds of that initial duration,
> the unit will experience an adrenaline rush. An adrenaline rush
> extends the initial duration by a minimum of 10 additional seconds.
> Every 5 seconds during the adrenaline rush, if enough total enemy
> kills happen, the rush is extended for another 5 seconds.

> The player who owns the unit being adrenalined gets a message when
> that unit experiences a rush, but no further messages are given if the
> rush extends longer than the first 10 second bonus. You can hear the
> sound effects of adrenaline refreshing, though. It doesn't matter who
> is responsible for the kills so all kills made by the team are
> important for helping adrenalined units maintain a rush. The number of
> kills required per 5 seconds to refresh the rush increases over the
> duration of the rush so it becomes harder to maintain the rush. Using
> adrenaline on a unit that is already on adrenaline will not reset its
> rush and is therefor a wasteful use of adrenaline. It's better to let
> the unit's rush wear off then use adrenaline on it.

> Try to use this skill on cooldown unless there is the need to save it
> for an upcoming boss or mini-boss.

### [Rapid Therapy](image:ability-therapy.gif "wikilink") [Rapid Therapy](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#therapy)

[right](file:tooltip-rapidtherapy.jpg "wikilink")

> Pay attention to the team status leaderboard to keep on eye on whoever
> gets injuries.

> Injuries can also be identified through sparkling on the players
> armor.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Mending Station](image:ability-station.gif "wikilink") [Mending Station](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#station)

[right](file:tooltip-mender.jpg "wikilink")

> Place one of these by the Tank whenever he is engaging the mob or a
> boss to keep him healed without endangering yourself. The mender has a
> mend range of 650, which is a much greater distance than your own
> which requires to be right next to the person you are mending.

> Place one of these in the middle of the party or by civs to keep
> everyone healed when team health is low.

> You may immediately cast this for 500 instead of waiting for the
> cooldown. Waiting for the cooldown lowers the mana cost of this spell
> back to 250.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Revive](image:ability-revive.gif "wikilink") [Revive](http://www.redscull.com/swat/classinfo-medic.htm#revive)

[right](file:tooltip-revive.jpg "wikilink")

> This innate levels up with your hero, giving a percentage based chance
> for a cost reduction and to ignore cooldown.

### Hints/Tips

-   Medics should ***<u>always have health bars turned
    on</u>***<span style="font-style: normal;">. This option can be
    enabled even in game by going into gameplay options. It is the
    checkbox at the bottom.''
-   The job of a Medic, like all classes in SWAT, is to dps as much as
    possible without neglecting its primary role. Furthermore, if a
    Medic is included in a class call, he will have the easiest access
    to healing abilities. To fail to utilize the Medic's healing
    abilities is to either leave the team lacking in healing or force
    another player slot to devote more of its resources (like trait,
    spec, items, etc.) to healing. Long story short, because a Medic
    *can* heal, the game will be easiest for the team when he *does*
    heal. That said, the better the Medic, the fewer points need be
    invested in healing and the more that can be invested in damage. If
    you need more points in healing to fulfill your role, then you will
    have fewer invested in damage. What this means is that if you want
    to output a lot of damage as a medic, you should focus on improving
    your ability to heal, and this will leave more points for you to
    output damage with. Example: Healer Triage is a build that can heal
    absurdly well, but many people will say that it is more than
    necessary. Some Medics (the less skilled ones) will need Healer
    Triage to heal sufficiently. If a player is skilled enough without
    going Healer Triage, then he could pick Dragoon Weaponry to improve
    his dps. This is how good Medics are the ones that can deal damage
    and bad medics are the one's whose dps is limited because he needs
    to invest more in his healing. \~NmdSnprEnigma
