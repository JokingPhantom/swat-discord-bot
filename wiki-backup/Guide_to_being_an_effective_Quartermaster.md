*This guide will explain basic strategies behind effective qming and
overall item management. While there will be some explanation of
overarching game strategy, this guide assumes the reader understands
basic game objectives and strategies to accomplish them. For a more
comprehensive summary of game strategy and tactics, please refer to this
[guide](Advanced_Pathing_and_Tactics "wikilink"). Any values referenced
will be for [extinction](extinction "wikilink") difficulty (ie.
[objective](Objectives "wikilink") gold awarded).*

## Introduction

The quartermaster is a mandatory role, required in any class call. They
work closely with the leader (if not leading) in managing team
resources, obtaining items from the [Lab](Lab "wikilink") and generally
ensuring players’ needs are met. Often referred to as the “qm,” they are
responsible for the [Recall](Lab#Recall "wikilink"), an item purchased
from the Lab that allows the hero to travel to and from the lab, along
with adjacent allied heroes. They are in essence the group’s Executive
Officer (XO), aiding the leader in long-term objective planning and
directing other members to goals, such as obtaining items or spending
resources. The role is also unique in that it can be performed
effectively by any class (sometimes requiring necessary traits) or by
other core roles (ie. the tank can be qm if called upon). Traditionally
this role has been assigned to a support class, or one with high
intelligence, who's presence will not be missed from the group for short
periods of time.

The following is required to qm at the most basic level:

-   Holding and being able to use the recall (requires 110 effective
    [Intelligence](https://swataftermath.com/tools/int.html) including
    [traits](traits "wikilink"))
-   Obtaining these essential items quickly as required:
    [**batteries**](Consumable#Batteries "wikilink"),
    [**revive**](Consumable#Revive "wikilink"),
    [bandages](Consumable#Bandages "wikilink"),
    [claymores](Consumable#Claymores "wikilink"), Top Secret items
    ([Freeze Ray](Lab#Freeze_Ray "wikilink") in particular may be
    required quickly at times)

If you are new, everything else can be effectively managed by another
more experienced player or by transporting said player to lab - simply
by using the recall when they are adjacent. If nothing else, familiarize
yourself with the location of the above **bolded** items, which lab
vendor sells them, their price and where they are on the grid.

## Strategy

This section will focus on the ‘*what*’ of qming, in terms of tasks,
responsibilities and goals the player should hope to accomplish over the
course of the game. These responsibilities can be summarized into 3
categories: **item, gold** and **valor management**.

### Item Management

#### Emergency Items

Emergency Items relate to the immediate survival of the group. These
include [batteries](Consumable#Batteries "wikilink") for players,
[bandages](Consumable#Bandages "wikilink") and
[revives](Consumable#Revive "wikilink"). *This is the highest priority
of the qm*.

The randomness of SWAT leads to infinitely different situations where an
emergency item could be required. While communication and awareness
contribute to a quick response - certain scenarios naturally lend
themselves to requiring an emergency item. Needing an emergency item can
be associated with the following risk factors:

-   Fighting a boss, particularly [Sludge](Sludge "wikilink"), or a
    prolonged encounter (having [SM](Super_Mutant "wikilink") heal,
    [Horror](Horror "wikilink") sleep or [Umbrella
    Commando’s](Umbrella_Commandos "wikilink") revive)
-   Being unable to camp/hold a position (ie. constantly being overrun
    during game) *This situation can make it challenging to recall -
    make sure you aren’t left behind!*
-   High [radiation](Reduce_Radiation "wikilink"): A horror with high
    base rads, after destroying the Super Rad or a Red Rad.
-   The tank not being cleared of zombies
-   The group taking a large amount of damage (usually from bad
    [pathing](Advanced_Pathing_and_Tactics#Mob_Management "wikilink"))
-   Fighting [Nemesis](Nemesis "wikilink"), particularly after a Mind
    Slay or Nuke and during “wimps” or “graveyard” phases.

#### Macro Items

Macro Items relate to the strategic progression of the game. These
include the recall, [antidotes](Lab#Antidotes "wikilink"), batteries to
fill a reactor, claymores, [hazmat](hazmat "wikilink") and Top Secret
items. They are a high priority to obtain in a timely matter to keep the
group completing objectives smoothly and quickly. Time is the enemy in
SWAT as zombies strengthen over time.

Of the three types of items, the leader will be most concerned with
macro items. The order in which to obtain these items depend on a
variety of factors related to leadership style, map layout and group
composition. A good leader will preemptively inform you of their
intentions. A mediocre leader will need prompting of the next objective
while a poor leader will be slow, even with prompts, to make a decision.
Poor leadership may paradoxically give you more time to accomplish your
duties at the expense of failing late game when zombies are too strong.
It is important to constantly be thinking about what the next logical
objective is. This can be quite difficult to do if you are new. Instead,
if you are are still learning to QM, don’t try to anticipate the next
objective, rather when the current one is near completion (ie. the
reactor/apc is nearly full) prompt the leader what they would like next.

The following is a rough idea of the required macro items depending on
the objective.

-   Call an APC - antidotes for everyone - as rescuing civilians becomes
    more difficult with each rescue the final 8 civs will likely require
    more than 10 antidotes per person. *Don't be afraid to temporarily
    drop items before recalling to grab 4-5 stacks of dotes from lab.*
-   [Reactors](Restore_Power "wikilink") - Depends on the location and
    the severity of the reactor. \[List mana requirements, time to fill
    each reactor\]
-   The [Super Rad](Reduce_Radiation#Super_rad "wikilink") - 1-2 stacks
    of Claymores
-   Selling [hazmat](hazmat "wikilink") - group needs to be stacked
    nicely to recall.

*Tip: If not rushed, using any of these above recalls as opportunities
for valor or micro item management can save time later.*

Gold management is very important to balance early game, while macro
items are still unpurchased. Generally the leader will decide what order
to purchase, but the rough assumption is if near 1500g be conservative
with spending in case a top secret is urgently needed, (until all 3 are
purchased at least once).

#### Micro Items

This refers to obtaining items related to individual enhancement of
players’ heroes. These include plan items, and stims but also any item
that would effectively improve a hero. This is the most
challenging/micro-intensive portion of qming and many players neglect
this role due to apm burden, inexperience or laziness.

While the benefit of micro item management is perhaps the most nuanced,
this proactivity can soften the severity of reactive tasks (ie.
emergency item usage). To give a simple example, the Umbrella Clone with
enough stopping power to control the mob because you’ve given them
sufficient items can prevent a tank from burning excess batteries or
potentially dying, requiring a reaction of recalling for batteries.

### Gold Management

### Valor Management

## The Lab

The QM generally spends more time in the [lab](lab "wikilink") than any
other player. Doing this efficiently is important for multiple reasons:
The longer spent in the lab, the more global
[aggro](Player_Mechanics#Aggro "wikilink") is drawn to the lab resulting
in an ambush on subsequent recalls. Secondly, experience is not awarded
in lab so prolonged time spent over the course of the game usually
results in being multiple levels lower than the team.

Organization of the lab is a duty mainly split between quartermaster and
solo but also any snipers present. While the solo will be bringing items
to the lab initially, the qm will be manipulating and shuffling these
items amongst the group and is responsible for maintaining organization.
An efficient solo is a highly valuable asset to a qm. A good solo will
spend minimal time in lab to avoid drawing zombie aggro, and have a
strategy for item placement. An exceptional solo will ensure haz is sold
from lab and your design plans are made or have the required items.

An efficient lab layout allows for rapid assessment of items and
improves recall turnaround.There are many ways to effectively organize a
lab and while there are specific styles, certain organizational
characteristics are highly conserved amongst all players. Below is but
one example of a rough layout. Note - the lab will rarely be this clean
without a sniper - if it does this is likely a sign the solo is spending
too much time organizing and drawing unnecessary risk with global aggro.

![](QM_Lab.png "QM_Lab.png")

Lab item management can be roughly divided into 3 main categories as
seen in the image.

**High Priority** items need to be obtained quickly, failure to do so
can lead to wiping. The locations of these items are generally highly
conserved amongst players (ie. all players store batteries in the top
right and know to look there if needed). Note that these high priority
items are stored in the top half of the bunker and ideally as close to
midline as possible, so the qm can return as quickly as possible, while
avoiding any possible ambush.

**Situational Priority** items are commonly requested or comprise other
objectives that need to be accomplished but if delayed will not
out-right wipe the group. These are largely situational based on group
composition and difficulty. For example stims are critical to killing
the Super Rad on Extinction, but building a LAD without a techies is a
relatively lower priority. Single batteries (‘1b’) and antidotes (not
shown) are only required in the lab with a Heavy Ordnance or Sniper in
game, respectively.

**Downtime Priority** items are not mandatory to win the game, as seen
in the case study below. However, effective management of these items is
what seperates a good QM from a great QM. Organizing these items are the
most time consuming, and should only be done during a prolonged trip to
lab (ie. while the group is safely camping). This stems from the fact
that only 1 combat vest or rapid reload can be held at a time, so
sorting is tedious. Organizing these will also allow identification of
excess sellable items, and any items which need to be purchased for
plans.

**Miscellaneous** by leaving large open spaces (‘dumping grounds’
above), players who would otherwise not sort the lab will be able to
drop items in safe areas. It is most important to keep items away from
a. Emergency items, b. Lab vendors and c. The middle where players
appear during recall (as the items are effectively hidden during
subsequent recalls). The potential for misclicks on these areas can
unnecessarily delay action in the lab at crucial times.

## Tactics

The previous section focused on the ‘what’, whereas this section will
provide advice relative to the ‘how’. At a high level it would seem
there is little mechanics required for the qm but a few nuanced
techniques can elevate gameplay significantly.

Lab hotkey/keybind

Armor type

Class selection low man vs high man

Recalling during tors - time to finish a tor

Recalling during civs - time to finish civs

Sprint

Forcing Recall on allies - candidates

Recalling to a full lab - sprint/alice shield/alice stopping power

Awareness and communication, in particular, factor so heavily into SWAT
that a new player possessing a high calibre of these skills can
effectively play and even win at high difficulties alongside veterans.

Voice chat is a boon for communication, as typing effectively disables
your hero. Voice chat truly shines, however, as a tool to increase the
group’s proficiency. Being able to improve their communication by
vocally directing them, or advising them on specific mechanics (ie. to
deal with a priority threat) when they otherwise would not have realized
will make your qming life (and the game) much easier and strengthen the
group as a whole.

Clays Tips A good GS is a life saver - engi partner too 4-6 man
easiest - good balance of core roles filled without the item overload of
high mans. Nightmare and below give good exposure to learning macro item
management - fall short in other tasks due to speed/lack of
emergency/item requirements. Macro items will have a stronger impact in
lower difficulties (freeze ray is stronger, claymores last longer) but
objective gold is also increased so gold management is considerably
easier too.

Recall with a plan Know where your emergency items are/Learn the hotkeys
of important items Time management - X seconds to convert civs, y
seconds to fill tors, how many recalls can you squeeze in during that
time (should be at least 2)

*A quick word on “The 3 Pillars”*

I feel SWAT skill can largely be grouped into 3 main categories or
‘pillars’. These are awareness/communication, strategy and mechanics. A
good player should have an acceptable proficiency in at least 2 of the 3
pillars. For example, someone with adequate communication and strategic
skill can fall short in mechanics (ie. Photon_man24).

## Case Review (code-name: Bruce)

This is an 8-man extinction lab 2 minutes after night time (8 minutes
into game); antidotes have spawned and the group has just left south to
the APC. The solo found 2 item rooms early and close to lab so this is
an usual 8 minute start. There are a 7+ man level of items (the most
possible). The organization is decent, items are mostly grouped
together. Importantly, they are almost all in the bottom half, keeping
space up for “emergency items” (1 bats, revives etc). Even more
importantly, the solo sacrificed precision placement to spend less than
10 seconds in lab. Spending less time reduces global aggro and a
potential ambush. This is vital early game as the qm still has low
nanites. ![](QM_Bruce_1.png "QM_Bruce_1.png")

The solo has done a good job this early in the game, but Bruce has
fallen short. He called the apc and bought dotes out but here are some
examples of improvement for this lab visit:

**Basic Improvement:** Put the blue plans in the corner neatly with the
others. Grab the duo and mfg with your 2 empty slots.

*This is a good start - don’t try to rush and do too much early on. Just
grab a few items (prioritize regen) and don’t fall behind the group.
Don't forget your antidotes and most importantly recall if you don't
have it yet. It's good to want to organize the lab but this early may
not be the best time to do so.*

**Advanced Improvement**: Grab 2 mfgs with your empty slots and locker
the \[Storage Generator\] plan, 1 mfg, 1 sto cell and 2 kevlars. Hack
the Kevlars.

*Lockering in lab has 0 mana cost and no cooldown. You have very quickly
reduced a third of the items in lab into tangible early game benefits.
Storage Generator is a safe plan to make early game if there is a
surplus of items as someone can always use it. Beware of hacking early
kevlars with a survivalist or unmutated maverick in game.*

**Wrong Answer**: You grab the best plan, the \[Tesla Vest mk2\] and
using the 3 mfgs you make it. You also notice there is a duo, 3 ammos
and a rr2 - these are the 5 items used to rebuild LADs. You move them
into the corner to ensure no one takes the items unnecessarily.

*You spent too much time in the lab and accomplished little. Tv2 is a
late-game item and might take another 15 minutes before its sustainable
by a player. You have also used all of the mfgs, leaving none to dupe by
the engineer. Identifying items to build a lad (early rebuilt lads are a
high priority) is good but the team camping the middle of the map will
cause global aggro issues for your next recall.*
![](QM_Bruce_2.png "QM_Bruce_2.png")

Here is a screenshot from the same game at 45 minutes (37 minutes
later). The team has recalled 12 times, Bruce has brought other heroes
multiple times. The techies brought himself once, to make a lad and
obtain items

Current lab inventory:

-   Total gold - 7441
-   Total valor - 107
-   Stogen2 Plans x1
-   TV1 Plans x1
-   TV2 Plans x1
-   Mfg x2
-   Mfg+ x2
-   Storage Duo-Cell x1
-   Storage Cell x3
-   Kevlar Vest x3
-   Combat Vest x2
-   Combat Vest MkII x5
-   Combat Vest MkIII x2
-   Rapid Reload x2
-   Rapid Reload MkII x1
-   Refined Stims x3
-   Ultra Stims x1
-   Mentat x1
-   Pill Pouch x1
-   Revive x4
-   Ammo x3
-   Bandages x1
-   Temporal Distortion Field x1

This lab has twice as many items now. The lack of organization and
locker ‘dumping’ make it difficult to identify needed items and this is
reflected by the team’s inventory.

-   The HO still has 2 empty slots
-   The techies has 120 int but is using 3 mfgs and a cv1 instead of the
    2xmfg+ and cv2
-   The demo has a storage cell instead of the duo-cell
-   All 3 LADs are fully built - the ammo should be used on heroes/CPU
-   The lab has all items needed to make Tv1 or Stogen2 (if the techies
    replaced 2 mfgs for mfg+ then both could be made)
-   The following items will never be used by team and can be safely
    sold:
-   CV3 x1, Kevlar x3, rr1 x1, cv2 x2, cv1 x1, Refined stim x2 (sold
    last and only if money is needed)

Enacting these 6 improvements gradually over the course of the previous
12 recalls would use 20 of the 41 items to **improve the team by a
combined 133% regen, 1250 mana and 3 ammo.** This isn’t factoring in
**107 unspent valor,** effectively another 100% regen to the team. These
are a lot of free resources going unused and team performance is
suffering for it. Bruce would end up making the plans 40 minutes later,
after incorrectly requesting extra mfgs to be purchased from abms. The
ammo remained uneaten but the team eventually did win.
