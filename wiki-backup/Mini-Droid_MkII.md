The **Mini-Droid MkII** **(Mini2)** is a second generation miniature
assault droid that acts as a versatile support unit. Created via the
Top-Secret Droid Remote item, they are initialized based on their
creator (more info below). They cannot gain levels after creation so
they must be destroyed and recreated to benefit from their creator's
advancement. The Mini2 will rapidly lose energy (-100 eps) and won't be
able to move or shoot if the officer controlling the Droid Remote leaves
its 1400 radius (unless built by a [Pack Rat
Trait](Traits#Pack_Rat "wikilink") Officer). Game difficulty is
increased somewhat by the level of each droid assisting players.

## Ability Levels and Skill Points

The Mini2's Trainable Ability levels are determined by the level of the
droid itself. The level of the Mini2 is determined when it is built,
based on the level of the creating Officer/LAD. In order to gain
additional levels, the Mini2 must be either destroyed or deconstructed,
and then rebuilt to be set at the new level. The table below shows what
level Swat Officers or LADs need to be to achieve a specific level of
Mini2, and what level its Trainable Abilities will be set to after
creation. Mini2s built by a LAD receive 1-3 skill points (equal to the
LAD Mk) to be spent on increasing the levels of the Trainable Abilities
further. Mini2s built by a Swat Officer receiver skill points for each
Circuit Board used by the Mini2 (up to 6).

|                            | Level |
|----------------------------|-------|
| **Swat Officer**           | 1     |
| **Assault Droid**          | 0     |
| **Mini-Droid MkII**        | 3     |
| Neutralize Computer System |       |
| Defense Matrix             |       |
| Storage Cells              |       |
| Energy Beam                | 1     |

## Trainable Abilities

### ![](Ability-neutralize.gif "Ability-neutralize.gif") Neutralize Computer System

This ability is very helpful during [Nem](Nemesis "wikilink") fight and
against [Commies](Umbrella_Commandos "wikilink"). It greatly reduces the
damage and armor of the targeted enemy Power Armored unit. Enemy Power
Armored units include: [Nemesis](Nemesis "wikilink"), Nemesis
Mini-Droids, Umbrella Commandos, Tyrants, the Umbrella [Assault
Droid](Assault_Droid "wikilink"), and regular Umbrella Soldiers.

If a **regular** Umbrella Solider is targeted, the computer virus
immediately spreads to all other **regular** Umbrella Soldiers in a 900
radius.

### ![](Ability-defmatrix.gif "Ability-defmatrix.gif") Defense Matrix

This passive ability increases the armor of friendly units in a 625
radius. If the Mini2 is is built by a [LAD](Assault_Droid "wikilink") or
[Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink") Class, this matrix affects only
mechanical units, otherwise it only affects organic units.The matrix can
be stacked up to 4 times from 4 different Mini2s.

### ![](Ability-cell.gif "Ability-cell.gif") Storage Cells

This passive ability increases the maximum energy capacity of the Mini2.

### ![](Ability-beam.gif "Ability-beam.gif") Energy Beam

This ability is the main source of the Mini2's energy reserves. This
allows the Mini2 to drain energy from other units, Reactors, and
Televacs (should rarely, if ever, drain a Televac).

### ![](Ability-nanites.gif "Ability-nanites.gif") Nanites

Nanites is one of the most important abilities in the game, especially
for newer players. The Mini2's Nanite level progression follows Standard
Nanites (used by units in Medium armor) until level 21. At level 21, the
Mini2 Nanites have their own scale. There are 3 different calculations
for the Mini2's Nanites level based on who the droid is built by.

-   If the Mini2 is created by a non-[Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink")
    Officer, the formula for Nanites levels is: Officer Nanites levels
    (excluding any bonuses such as
    [Dragoon](Traits#Dragoon "wikilink")) + difficulty bonus + armor
    type shifter. The difficulty bonus is +1 for Nightmare, and +3 for
    Extinction. The armor type shifter is 0, 2, 5, 4 for Light, Medium,
    Heavy, and Advanced normally, and 0, 1, 4, 3 for
    [Espionage](Specializations#Espionage "wikilink") Officers.
-   If the Mini2 is created by a [Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink")
    Officer, the formula for Nanites levels is: MIN( i, 25) + difficulty
    bonus. The difficulty bonus is +1 for Nightmare, and +3 for
    Extinction. The variable "i" is equal to Officer Nanites levels
    (excluding any bonuses such as
    [Dragoon](Traits#Dragoon "wikilink")) + levels in CPU ability + an
    armor type shifter. The armor type shifter is 0, 2, 5, 4 for Light,
    Medium, Heavy, and Advanced normally, and 0, 1, 4, 3 for
    [Espionage](Specializations#Espionage "wikilink") Officers.
-   If the Mini2 is created by a LAD, the levels in Nanites are
    determined by the LAD Mk and the difficulty level. The formula for
    Nanites level is: 16 + 3 \* LAD Mk + difficulty bonus. The
    difficulty bonus is +1 for Nightmare, and +3 for Extinction.

## Innate Abilities

### ![](Ability-board.gif "Ability-board.gif") Use Circuit Board

Using Circuit Boards on the Mini2 grant the droid +1 skill point per
board (up to 6). Each color Circuit Board provides a different
additional benefit as outlined below. This ability is disabled for
LAD-built Mini2s.

-   Orange: +50 vitality - This provides 0.5 hps and helps survivability
    of the droid.
-   Green: +5 agility - This provides 10% attack speed which greatly
    benefits the DPS of the droid.
-   Purple: +1 eps - This provides energy regeneration to the droid
    which can also improve survivability. However, being the Mini2 can
    use Energy Beam to drain off other units, Purple Circuit Boards are
    not as useful as Orange and Green.

When a Mini2 is destroyed, any boards that were integrated are lost
(unless built by a [Pack Rat Trait](Traits#Pack_Rat "wikilink")
Officer). However, if you click on the Droid Remote to deconstruct the
Mini2, all integrated boards are dropped so that they can be used in a
new Mini2, or for other purposes like Gear Modding or Robo Modding.

### ![](Ability-ars.gif "Ability-ars.gif") A.R.S.

The Automated Repair System ability restores health to the droid equal
to the amount of vitality that the droid has divided by 100. (25
vitality = 0.25 hps). This ability is improved by integrating Orange
Circuit Boards.

### ![](Ability-laserfocus.gif "Ability-laserfocus.gif") Focus Laser

This ability increases the white damage of the Mini2 and is set equal to
the effective gun level of the creating Officer. Tech Ops-built Mini2s
also get additional levels based on points in Flamethrower ability. For
LAD-built Mini2s, the level is set based on the level of the LAD, and
the LAD Mk. The Focus Laser level is recorded on a per player basis, and
adjusted every time a player builds a droid. Whenever a droid is built,
all other droids will have their focus laser level updated to the same
number. If droid ownership is transferred by passing the Droid Remote to
another player, no change should occur, since this mechanic follows
similar principles to the melee Charm spell. This way, a player with
high gun level can contribute to the Focus Laser level without
controlling it themselves.

*\*Additional levels due to* *[Weaponry
Specialization](Specializations#Weaponry "wikilink"),
[Maverick](Maverick "wikilink") Officer, and Masamune Use ability*

### ![](Ability-gatling.gif "Ability-gatling.gif") Laser Heat

This ability adds additional damage when attacking bosses. This damage
is "black" or not visible damage. The level of this ability is set based
on the ammo level of the creating Officer (0-8 ammo) or LAD Mk for
LAD-built Mini2's (level 1, 4, or 7 based on LAD Mk).

## Other Stats

### ![<File:Item-ammo.jpg>](Item-ammo.jpg "File:Item-ammo.jpg") Droid Ammo

The level of ammo that the Mini2 receives is based on player count and
game difficulty.

|              | Ammo Level |
|--------------|------------|
| Player Count | Extinction |
| 1            | 2          |
| 2            | 3          |

| 9            | 10         |

### ![<File:ability-batt.gif>](ability-batt.gif "File:ability-batt.gif") Energy Regeneration

The Mini2 innately has 1 eps, however several factors can affect this
value:

-   LAD-built Mini2s receive additional regeneration based on the LAD
    Mk: +1, +3, and +6 eps respectively.
-   If an Officer with [Pack Rat Trait](Traits#Pack_Rat "wikilink")
    builds a Mini2, instead of the Officer receiving the normal -1 eps,
    the Mini2 gets the -1 eps instead.
-   Using Purple Circuit Boards increase with the Mini2 increase the
    regeneration by +1 eps per board as stated
    [above](Mini-Droid_MkII#Use_Circuit_Board "wikilink").
-   [Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink") Class can Robo-Mod a Mini2 with up
    to 2 additional Purple Circuit Boards granting +1 eps per board.

### ![<File:ability-sprint.gif>](ability-sprint.gif "File:ability-sprint.gif") Move Speed

The move speed of the Mini2 is based on the Armor Type of the Officer
creating it or the LAD Mk for LAD-built Mini2s.

| Officer Armor/LAD Mk | Move Speed |
|----------------------|------------|
| Light Armor          | 310        |
| Medium Armor         | 270        |
| Heavy Armor          | 240        |
| Advanced Armor       | 250        |
| LAD MkI              | 270        |
| LAD MkII             | 290        |
| LAD MkIII            | 300        |

The above table shows the Move Speed values for **most** of the Officers
building the Mini2, however there are a couple exceptions:

-   A Mini2 built by a [Sniper](Covert_Sniper "wikilink") Officer, or an
    Officer using the [Espionage](Specializations#Espionage "wikilink")
    Specialization, wearing Light Armor loses 20 move speed (290 ms) as
    opposed losing a level in Nanites like other armor types do.
-   A Mini2 built by a [Tech Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink") Officer uses a
    more complex formula for calculating its move speed: (Move speed
    from the above chart, adjusted for Espionage if necessary) - 20 + 5
    \* MAX( i - 25, 0 ). The "i' value is the [Tech
    Ops](Tech_Ops "wikilink") Officer's levels in Nanites (excluding any
    bonuses such as [Dragoon](Traits#Dragoon "wikilink")) + levels in
    CPU ability + an armor type shifter. The armor type shifter is 0, 2,
    5, 4 for Light, Medium, Heavy, and Advanced normally, and 0, 1, 4, 3
    for [Espionage](Specializations#Espionage "wikilink") Officers.

### ![<File:ability-armor.gif>](ability-armor.gif "File:ability-armor.gif") Armor Bonus

The Mini2 innately has 1 point of armor. The droid can gain additional
initial armor by being built by a non-Tech Ops Officer in Nightmare or
Extinction gaining +2 or +6 respectively. Tech Ops and LAD-built Mini2s
do not receive this additional armor.

## Hints/Tips/Other Information

-   If a Sniper Class is playing a solo game and builds a Mini2 into a
    LAD, that Mini2 receives Cloak as well.
-   LAD-built Mini2s are brown instead of the owning Officer's color.
-   LAD-built Mini2s have their vitality and agility stats copied from
    the LAD creator instead of the normal Mini2 stats.
-   In a typical game (around an hour), you can only get 3 Droid Remotes
    (2 from the lab, and one [Engineer](Traits#Engineer "wikilink")
    duplicated.) The cooldown timer on the sale of Droid Remote from the
    Scientist is 44 minutes, so you would be able to purchase another
    one at 88 minutes, 132 minutes, etc. However, the max cap of Droid
    Remotes in the Scientist at any given time is 2 Remotes, so if you
    don't purchase at least 1 before 44 minutes, the timer doesn't start
    until he has 1 or 0 remotes for sale. (This is the same as all
    Top-Secret items sold by the Scientist.)
-   As noted [above](Mini-Droid_MkII#Defense_Matrix "wikilink"), Defense
    Matrix stacks up to 4 times. This is actually up to 4 times on
    Organic Units, and a separate 4 times on Mechanical Units. This
    means that technically, you could have 8 Mini2 Defense Matrix auras
    active at once, however this isn't really feasible since it would
    take 264 minutes to get 7 Droid Remotes + 1 duplicated with Engineer
    to achieve this (or 308 minutes without an Engineer.)
-   Maximize Mini2 Focus Laser level by having one Officer on the team
    get maximum gun skill (16+). Have this Officer build the Mini2 once,
    then pass it to whoever uses Mini2s to set their Focus Laser level
    as high as possible. The Mini2 can then be recreated by the other
    Officer(s) to take advantage of other bonuses, such as high levels,
    nanites, ammo level, and Packrat Bonus. The higher Focus Laser level
    is also applied to LAD built Mini2s, if the current owner of the LAD
    has had their Focus Laser level set higher via Droid Remote
    transfer.
