Every Officer can earn up to six types of medals. Medals are earned
after meeting specific criteria and after winning the game. The medals
that your Officer has earned can be displayed in-game with the [-info
command](Commands "wikilink"). They will appear gray and in lower case
if unearned, and gold and in CAPS when the Officer has earned them.

A tool is available to track your Medal chances here: [Medal Chances
Tool](https://swataftermath.com/tools/medals.html). **Note: This tool
will give you exact chances and reveal to you the exact requirements for
each Medal. If you would prefer to figure these out on your own, do not
use this tool.**

Medal bonuses are only activated when attempting
[Extinction](Extinction "wikilink") as a team or
[Nightmare](Nightmare "wikilink") alone. Medals can only be earned if
playing with teammates, however if your team drops and you are the only
player left, you can still earn a medal.

Only one of each medal can be earned per game, and each player can only
earn one medal per game. The medals are given out in the following
order: KEY, MOH, PCC, COB, LSA, REM. The 'most eligible' Officer gets
the best medal, and down the line.

'Eligibility' is determined by a point scale where Honor Guard wins out
over all, then Rank, and then Medals. If there is an exact tie between
two Officers, then whoever loaded their Rank Code first has higher
'eligibility'.

|             | Point Value |
|-------------|-------------|
| Honor Guard | 500         |
| Rank        | 20 per Rank |
| KEY         | 40          |
| MOH         | 20          |
| PCC         | 10          |
| COB         | 3           |
| LSA         | 3           |
| REM         | 1 per REM   |

### ![](Medal-rem.gif "Medal-rem.gif") Recognition for Exceptional Merit

**Effect:** Increases personal hazard pay by 40-80.

**Min. Rank:** N/A

**Min. Difficulty:** [Normal](Normal "wikilink")

**Additional Information:** May earn up to three of this medal (earning
40, 60 and 80 hazard pay respectively). REM is also determined by order
of 'eligibility', however each Officer has a chance at 'rolling' for the
medal and then the next eligible Officer (that has not earned another
medal) 'rolls' for it, and so on. If no one 'rolls' properly, it is
possible that no one will earn it.

**To Earn:** Earned for defeating a wide variety of bosses. Includes
Abominations, Horrors, Super Mutants, Sludges, and Godzilla. Note: Must
defeat at least 3 of the first 4 boss types listed on the left in order
to qualify for any chance at REM.

### ![](Medal-pcc.gif "Medal-pcc.gif") Police Combat Cross

**Effect:** Modifies weapon, increasing its damage.

**Min. Rank:** 10

**Min. Difficulty:** [Insane](Insane "wikilink")

**Additional Information:** Damage increase is equal to the ["Mod."
amount by weapon](http://redscull.com/swat/readmeafterweapons.html).

**To Earn:** Earned by defeating a large number of [Umbrella
Soldiers](Umbrella_Soldiers "wikilink"), [Umbrella
Commandos](Umbrella_Commandos "wikilink"), and defeating
[Nemesis](Nemesis "wikilink"). Also requires defeating Commandos
'perfectly'. Chances are reduced due to deaths caused by Umbrella
Soldiers and Commandos. Note: Only Umbrella's defeated before Nemesis
spawns count toward the medal (besides Nemesis himself of course).

Defeating Commandos 'perfectly' requires that they don't revive each
other, no one dies to the Commandos, and you kill them together (not
spread out over time.)
