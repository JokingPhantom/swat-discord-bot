-   Because WM are very capable of putting out single-target damage with
    their gun, it is often very useful in the team to max this 8 pt
    skill, as there will always be bosses to help with.
-   Coupled with ammos, [gear mods](Demolitions#gearmod "wikilink"), and
    damage buffs, the Watchman makes for an especially good target for
    an attack speed buff such as [Adrenaline](Medic#adren "wikilink").
-   Because the Watchman's gun skill increases base damage, he is a
    particularly good choice for +% damage, such as [Zeal
    Mag.](ATME#zealmag "wikilink") and the Prodigy Strategian, a
    Returner from the [Paradox](Watchman#paradox "wikilink") ability.
-   Each point in Focus laser carries a 5% energy degen penalty.
-   The degen can be lessened by spending points in Laser Dissipation
    under Custom Loadout.
-   The degen is reflected by a status effect. The level of this degen
    is the percent degen (16% = 1 eps)

====<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren.gif>

\> [image:Watchman_-_Upgrade_X-Grenade.jpg width="245"
height="189"](image:Watchman_-_Upgrade_X-Grenade.jpg_width="245"_height="189" "wikilink")

-   X-Grenade can be a very powerful crowd control or damage ability for
    a class with plenty of energy regeneration options.
-   [Commies](Bosses#commies "wikilink") \*\*have a chance to dodge
    X-grenade regardless of its upgrades,\*\* so if they are bunched up,
    avoid using this ability unless the commies are heavily slowed via
    [Molotov](Pyrotechnician#molotov "wikilink"), concussion grenade or
    Plasma Rounds.
-   While specialization is very easy and possible with the X-grenade, a
    combination of its upgrades will make it useful in a greater variety
    of situations.

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_rep.gif>Replication](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_rep.gif "wikilink")\*\*
\>\> <span style="display: block; font-family: Arial;">Refunds a portion
of the energy required to replicate the grenade and optimizes the hero's
generator while using grenades.</span> \>\> //Each point increases
energy refunded by 1% and energy regeneration by 1 eps for 20 seconds//.
\>\> //Maxed it refunds 8% mana and 8 eps for// //20 secs for a total of
180 mana at level 11//.

-   -   \*\*Replication does not stack.\*\* If another X-Nade is cast
        within 20 secs the Replication timer will reset. To make the
        most out of Replication make sure to only cast X-Nade once every
        20 secs.
    -   With only 8 levels of replication, a L8 X-nade will cost 175
        energy to throw. It will refund 14 energy and regenerate 160
        (over the next 20 seconds) for a sum total of 174 energy
        refunded. This is effectively a //free// grenade if used
        sparingly. If spammed, the last grenade of any given spam
        session will essentially be free.
    -   Levels in replication allow the grenade to be relatively cheaply
        be used for its innate damage and not for its special effects.
    -   Although this upgrade is most effective when x-nade is used not
        more often than once every 20 seconds, don't let this dissuade
        you from using it when necessary.

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_leth.gif>Lethality](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_leth.gif "wikilink")\*\*
\>\> //Increases the explosive damage of the grenades at the point of
impact. Half of the bonus damage ignores armor and nanites.// \>\>
//Each point increases bonus damage by 22.5%.// \>\> //Maxed increases
damage by 180% doing 1540 damage in a 96 radius where 495 of it ignores
armor and nanites in a 69 radius at level 10 X-Grenade.//

-   -   While Lethality is excellent in that some of the damage bypasses
        nanites, it can be very dangerous to teammates. Be extremely
        careful when using Lethality-based x-nades around the group.
    -   This upgrade's effectiveness against
        [commies](Bosses#commies "wikilink") is limited by the fact that
        they can attempt to dodge the grenade, similar to how they dodge
        the [Tactician](Tactician "wikilink")'s [Ion
        Strike](Tactician#ion "wikilink") and the
        [Demolitions's](Demolitions "wikilink")
        [Mini-nuke](Demolitions#nuke "wikilink") .

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_nap.gif>Napalm](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_nap.gif "wikilink")\*\*
\>\> //Leaves a persistent patch of burning napalm at the point of
impact which causes damage over time and reduces armor by 4.// \>\>
//Actual duration determined by the level of your X-Grenade ability.//
\>\> //Maxed does 80dps in a 192 radius for 11 seconds at level 10
X-Grenade.//

-   -   This upgrade does \*\*not\*\* stack with the napalm from
        [M.I.R.V.](demolitions#mirv "wikilink") in either damage or
        armor reduction, though it can substitute for it quite well.
    -   Having 11 or more levels in x-grenade is helpful because it
        allows the grenade to be thrown farther from the team, allow the
        napalm damage to have a greater effect on the zombies before
        they reach the team.
    -   Mixing napalm with Distortion (below) will keep both air and
        ground targets in the area of effect of the napalm, multiplying
        the damage it does to enemies.

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_dist.gif>Distortion](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-gren_dist.gif "wikilink")\*\*
\>\> //Creates a temporal rift at the point of impact, slowing all units
which pass through by 25%. Power Armored units are shielded from the
effect.// \>\> //Adding points increases radius and max duration.// \>\>
//Actual Duration determined by the level of your X-Grenade ability//
\>\> //Maxed slows atk speed and move speed by 25% in a 500 radius for
11 seconds at level 10 X-Grenade.//

-   -   Distortion is often compared to
        [Molotov](Pyrotechnician#molotov "wikilink"), but they provide
        different effects. Distortion also slows the attack speed of
        units in the AoE, making it great to place on
        [bosses](bosses "wikilink") to help protect the
        [tank](Aspects_of_a_Class_Call#tank "wikilink"). Distortion will
        slow air units such as [gargs](Grotesque_info "wikilink") that
        Molotov misses. Furthermore, because Power Armor units are
        immune to Distortion, this can be used to help a [Mecha
        Mutt](Robo#mecha "wikilink") dance very effectively.

[\#paradox](#paradox "wikilink") \>
====<span style="color: #000000; text-decoration: none;">[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox.gif>
link="<http://redscull.com/swat/classinfo-watchman.htm#paradox>"](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox.gif_link="http:/redscull.com/swat/classinfo-watchman.htm#paradox" "wikilink")[2](http://redscull.com/swat/classinfo-watchman.htm#paradox%7CParadox)</span>====
\> [image:Watchman_-_Expand_Paradox.jpg width="242"
height="224"](image:Watchman_-_Expand_Paradox.jpg_width="242"_height="224" "wikilink")

-   -   Putting points into Paradox is an excellent way to buff
        teammates rivaled only by the Tactician. There are both ways to
        increase dps or the survivability of the team, but to do so will
        require a good degree micro skills.
    -   Though Returners are fairly easy to keep alive because they draw
        no aggro, make sure you keep them out of harm's way. Permitting
        your returns to die is a waste of any energy they may have had
        on them in addition to the energy needed to recreate them.
    -   If Paradox is canceled before a returner dies, he or she will
        have the same energy when Paradox is used again.
    -   Paradox units can be individually dismissed to conserve energy
        when not needed.

\>\> \>\> \>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_rep.gif>Field](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_rep.gif "wikilink")
Nurse\*\* \>\> //This woman grew up fascinated by stories of the zombie
epidemic and its heroes; she gladly accepted a chance to be part of that
history. She can mend civilians, and her titillating charm// //increases
the morale of close-by comrades, increasing their attack speed; the
watchman is particularly enamored.// \>\> //Adding points increases the
attack speed bonus and healing rate.// \>\> //Maxed heals civilians by
50 per mend, increases attack speed by 50% in a 625 radius.//

-   -   When a Nurse acquires 250 energy, she can cast Nano-Inject. She
        will do so automatically when a hero reaches critical health. If
        you [call for help](Skills#help "wikilink") when you are missing
        at least 200 health, the Nurse will use Nano-Inject on you three
        seconds later.
    -   Field Nurse is critical during the Nem fight to react quickly to
        Nem's slay, but is not 100% effective
    -   Field Nurse can save someone even if she is dead but not
        cancelled, as long as she had 250 energy when she died.

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_prod.gif>Prodigy](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_prod.gif "wikilink")
Strategian\*\* \>\> //This boy was born with a knack for weapon accuracy
and telepathically assists comrades with their targeting, increasing
their damage. Strategian also carries a riot shield, increasing armor of
himself and adjacent comrades.// \>\> //Adding points increases damage
bonus.// \>\> //Maxed increases damage by 35% and armor by 10 in a 144
radius.//

-   -   This returner allows for a significant damage boost when maxed,
        but even with a single point, he can provide very good HP
        assistance to health dependent
        [tanks](Aspects_of_a_Class_Call#tank "wikilink") via his Riot
        Shield aura.
    -   Prodigy Strategian is most effective on people who gain white
        damage such as watchmen and dragoon/weaponry heroes who eat
        ammos, and on heroes with crit (crit is a multiplier applied
        after the green damage boost of Prodigy Strategian)
    -   Nicknamed "Timmy"

\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_droid.gif>Military](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_droid.gif "wikilink")
Android\*\* \>\> //This robot uses advanced defense-optimization
algorithms to reduce the amount of melee damage received by close-by
allies in its wireless network range.// \>\> //Adding points increases
damage reduction bonus.////Nanites are dependent on the level of the
paradox ability// \>\> //Maxed reduces melee damage by 25% and reduces
attack speed by 20% in a 900 radius, and increases the survivability of
the android.//

-   -   In regards to all non-ranged attacks, this effectively provides
        (averaged out) evasion to the whole team, including the
        [tank](Aspects_of_a_Class_Call#tank "wikilink").
    -   As is the case with +armor, reducing the amount of damage your
        heroes take reduces the chance of taking
        [injuries](injuries "wikilink").

\>\>
\*\*[image:<http://redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_pharm.gif>Pharmacist](image:http:/redscull.com/swat/pics/ability-paradox_pharm.gif "wikilink")\*\*
\>\> //This patriot volunteered his services to aid in this crisis. He
can create drugs from his energy reserves and sells Revive kits.// \>\>
//Each point increases his energy regeneration aura by 0.5eps up to
level 5 and 1.0eps up to level 8, and the amount of energy saved from
death by 15%// \>\> //Maxed he has 500 mana cap and 5eps aura to himself
and other returners.//

-   -   [Drugs](Drugs "wikilink") created by pharmacist are immediately
        consumed upon picking up and thus \*\*cannot\*\* interact with
        [Chemistry](Specialization#chemistry "wikilink"), but will still
        be affected by [Flower Child](Traits#flowerchild "wikilink") and
        [Chemically Reliant](traits#chemreliant "wikilink").
    -   Because [Buffout](Drugs#buffout "wikilink") are so inexpensive,
        Pharmacist-created drugs are a valid way to heal.
        [Nemesis](Bosses#nemesis "wikilink") fights have been won
        largely dependent on such a strategy.
    -   In addition, due to his regeneration aura to other returns, he
        decreases the amount of energy needed or the need altogether to
        surge a Nurse and increases the survivablity of the Android
        giving his nanites higher energy regeneration.

Dissipation\*\* \>\> //Amplification mirrors allow the hero's weapon to

range of Laser Rifle by 100.// \>\> //Each point increases the damage of

Energy Degeneration received by points into Focus Laser by 20%.// \>\>
//Maxed increases Laser Rifle Range by 400 range or Gatling Laser damage
by 20 and negates Focus Laser degen by 80%.//

-   -   The extra range of the Laser Rifle allows the Watchman to aggro
        units with his gun from farther away, to hit priority targets
        before they hit the team, to reach umbs with having to wade
        through zombies and to remain a safer distance away from the
        front lines.
    -   The extra damage of the Gatling Laser is always useful, but is
        less than the damage from his gun skill. This allows the Gatling
        Laser to have a higher potential damage. This is white damage
        which stacks well with multipliers, but is not applied to
        avatars.

-   -   If this skill is maxed it makes more sense for the wm to burn
        batteries surging the tank than let the tank burn their own.

\> //Teleports the unit to its partner's location.// \> //Partner MUST
be set for the WM to teleport.// \> //Neither unit can be in the lab.//
\> //Uses 250 mana and 3s cd if above 500 mana else it uses 0 mana but a
150 second cd.// \> //Partner cannot be changed unless partner leaves
the game.// \> //If soloing, Partner skill acts as a
[Recall](Lab#Recall "wikilink").//

-   If your partner leaves the game you will need to use Partner so that
    it recognizes that he/she is gone; then you can Partner someone
    else.
-   Who you partner can also be important. Partnering a solo can mean
    you can [civ](civs "wikilink") earlier or revive them if they die,
    while if you plan on scouting it is best to partner a
    [Tactician](Tactician "wikilink") or [Demo](Demolitions "wikilink"),
    someone who won't be around zombies very often so if you recall to
    them you won't have to worry about dying.
-   Teleporting to partner takes a 3-second channel if \>1900 range from
    your partner. A 1.5-second channel is required if the partner is
    \>900 range. And a 0.75-second channel is required if the partner is
    within 900 range.
    -   Choosing the Power Armor spec does NOT prevent this penalty -
        only the armor penalty from death
    -   Breaking armor by completing a teleport is better than breaking
        armor by dying.
    -   If you have level 6 damaged power armor you will not have the
        option of breaking armor to complete a teleport.
-   If your partner leaves the game you will have to "use" your partner
    ability to get a message telling you to set a new partner
-   Who to partner
    -   It is a bad idea to partner the quartermaster or whoever is
        using the recall as you will effectively be without your partner
        button many times throughout the game since you can't teleport
        to your partner while he is in the lab
    -   It is a bad idea to partner the tank as he will likely be too
        close to mob when you return. Especially if you return in an
        emergency, you do not want to be anywhere near the mob
    -   It is usually best to partner a crowd control character. They
        tend to never be recalled and stand a good distance from the
        mob. A bmed or psy are also good ideas as they may be able to
        heal you as you return.
    -   Partner a person you trust. If you expect the demo to die or a
        newb to leave the game in 10 minutes, you don't want to be
        without your partner button. It is more important to partner
        someone you trust than the ideal class.

## Good Builds

### FCWM

Laser Rifle/Flower Child/Chemistry/Toughness

-   4 X-Grenade (0/2/1/1/) (Early nade to kill spiders in 1 shot)
-   10 Nanites
-   8 Laser + 4 dissipation (scale as needed with zombie mob HP)
-   11 X-Grenade (1/8/1/1) (scale with zombie mob HP, scale Lethality as
    game progresses in case commandos spawn)
-   4 gen
-   19 Nanites
-   4 deflection
-   1 nurse (get before Nemesis spawns)

With high intelligence, FCWM is a good choice for off tank. 19 Nanites,
Shield Capacitor, 4 Deflection, and 4 Aux. Gen.

11 Points into X-Grenade gives maximum Commando killing power, and gives
additional Priority Control and Crowd Control.

FCWM is a good unit to deal with the enemy Mini-Droids that Nemesis
spawns.

1.  The Laser damage from FCWM destroys Minis rapidly.
2.  X-Grenade is good at destroying Spider mines that spawn from the
    Mini-Droid's death.
3.  Try to time it so that the grenade lands right after the enemy
    Mini-Droid is destroyed.

8 Laser and 4 Dissipation gives great Priority Control and boss DPS.

1 Nurse protects from slays and spider bombs.

This is a skill point intensive build - Mental Clarity support from a
Psychologist is required to reliably reach the number of skill points
required.

Sacrifice a few points in X-Grenade/ Laser if there aren't enough skill
points to go around.

Use high int items, bandages, stims, and speeds to boost firepower,
energy regen and healing ability.

### Guides

[I'll Be Back - FerventPower](I'll_be_back "wikilink")

//Player submitted ways on how to play the class effectively// //Please
refrain from editing another player's guide if he/she asks not to//

#### Unlocking

The watchman is a special class that must be unlocked before he may be
played. To unlock the watchman, you have to complete a series of tasks.
The first task is found in [Nightmare](Nightmare "wikilink") mode and
has a small chance of beginning every time you rescue a
[civilian](civs "wikilink"). This chance decreases with more players in
the game. Check [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B56UrD5kKj8)
for a user-created video spoiler on the unlock process, or read below.

<div class="toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="overflow:auto;">
<div style="font-weight:bold;line-height:1.6;">

#### Spoiler

</div>

##### Step 1

<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

This is the most time consuming process of unlocking the WatchMan. The
only advice I can give to you is not get your hopes up, and Nightmare as
much as you usually would, while attempting to over do yourself with
Civving. Each Civilian (Going into the televac) Has a .22% (1 / 450)
Chance of giving you the First part of the WM Code. Now note, if you are
lucky enough to have this happen, it may not be brought up to your
attention. If you see a random 2 Umbrella Soldiers running out of the
bunker, kill them quickly, and revive the female Civ, and send her on
her way through the Televac! 

##### Step 2

Upon completing the Civving portion of the WM code, the Female Civilian
you rescued will tell you to type "Help" In the RCPD HQ, while
\***SOLOING**\* NightMare. You need to go to the building with the 2
Flags underneath the Lab, (AKA RCPD HQ) Go between the flags, and simply
type, "**HELP**"![](Watchman_unlock_1.jpg "Watchman_unlock_1.jpg")After
you have done this, 8 Umbrella Soldiers should spawn, as shown
below.![](Watchman_unlock_2.jpg "Watchman_unlock_2.jpg")There are
several ways to kill these Umbrella's quickly, the most effective are
Espionage Borg, and Demo. 

With Borg, just type help, turn ForceField on, use your Temp. Avatars,
and kill them. You don't have to do this quickly, for you have 9
Batteries (including your Built in Battery) 

With Demo, simple, nuke yourself. You don't need to live in order to get
the code. 

Congrats, you've got the 2nd Code!

##### Step 3

Sounds easy, but not necessarily. Find a decent team, load up all Rank
12's, and play Extinction. You don't have to camp the park, just loop
around until you see "ChronoTech has sent your squad a powerful item
from the future!" Go to park, get near it, and type "**-SEARCH**" Even
if your team is dead, except all but one person, and he/she gets to the
crate and types "**-SEARCH**" you should get the
code.![](Watchman_unlock_3.jpg "Watchman_unlock_3.jpg")Easy enough, step
3 is done, you have your code, 1 more to go!

##### Step 4

Okay, this might be somewhat annoying to figure out, but hey, I'm here
to help you! Join any regular Public Hard, and (To my knowledge) only
works on Normal, and Hard. I will try Insane on a later date. Make sure
some people are noobs, or have some friends just make Rank 1's. 

I'm not ENTIRELY sure what you have to do in order to get this, but it
works with public games, enough said. 

When everyone's done loading, or creating the Class Builds, type
"**-TRAIN**" And something like this should show
up.![](Watchman_unlock_4.jpg "Watchman_unlock_4.jpg")**NOTE:** you must
FINISH the Selected mode in order for you to get this part of the code,
and to my knowledge you only need 3-4 Rank 1-3's with 1 Rank 11/ 12
typing "**-TRAIN**" Not sure how many has to be alive at the
End.![](Watchman_unlock_5.jpg "Watchman_unlock_5.jpg")

##### Step 5

Put the 4 Codes you have earned together, load it in a game, and Wah-la!
The WatchMan! Now, give this Thread credit, do it.. Do it... 

**Credit**: Stealer, redscull (I wuv Swat!) the entire swat community
for their support, and
[myself](http://redscull.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5049) (of course). 

HAPPY HUNTING!
