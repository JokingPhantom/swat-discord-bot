Until Blizzard Classic stops breaking the World Editor, custom maps, and
Battle.net, Swat is only playable on v1.28.5 or thereabouts for Warcraft
III. This guide details how to install 1.28.5 parallel to your current
installation, and use a PvPGN realm for playing Swat.

### Connecting

All the downloaded tools should be place in the folder you extract
Warcraft III to.

1.  **Download** an archive with 1.28.5, from any of Eurobattle's[^1]
    mirrors:
    1.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror
        1)](https://mega.nz/#!2WhRBaLZ!z1H3_6qbNHjz7zIZqxymYw5LW4uTLYfgzwj5dYQ3GGM)
    2.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror
        2)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AoRRn80UJEHIgkqU4WRqvI085yE7)
    3.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror
        3)](https://my.pcloud.com/publink/show?code=XZrbij7ZBKU7SfFg3x5UOcu9yGyKCzWADElV)
    4.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror 4)](https://yadi.sk/d/yL8Dnz3Y3UP5KQ)
    5.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror 5)](http://k00.fr/05zd94dg)Â Pass:
        698366
    6.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror
        6)](http://xpam.pl/update/Warcraft_III_1.28.zip)
    7.  [Warcraft 3 1.28.5 (Mirror
        7)](https://my.syncplicity.com/share/ssdlraxdwezgibi/Warcraft_III_1.28)
2.  **Extract**[^2] to whatever folder you want to install in, eg.
    "D:\\Games\\Warcraft III 1.28.5".
    1.  If you have another version of Warcraft III installed, like
        1.30.1, use the [Warcraft III
        Fixer](https://www.engamers.com/download-warcraft-iii-fixer-w3fixer/)
        to change where Windows looks for the game.
    2.  Get the [Warcraft III PvPGN Loader
        1.28](https://www.engamers.com/download-warcraft-3-pvpgn-loader/),
        most versions from Eurobattle contain a copy of this, as
        *w3l.exe*
3.  Get the [Gateway
    Editor](https://www.engamers.com/blizzard-battle-net-gateway-editor/)
    and **add** a new realm with the following (see image below):
    -   Name: Swat
    -   Zone: 1
    -   IP: 45.33.71.125
    -   Then click "Set to Chosen Gateway"
4.  In the folder you extracted 1.28.5 to, make a **copy** of *Warcraft
    III.exe* and name it *war3.exe*
5.  **Run** Warcraft III from *w3l.exe*
    -   If you run *war3.exe* it won't connect via the
        "Battle.net"-button
6.  Set the Gateway to *Swat*, and connect to Battle.net

You can now host and join games on a PvPGN-network exclusively using
Warcraft III 1.28.5.

#### GProxy

##### Gproxy++

Download from
[Mega.nz](https://mega.nz/#!wkcRgSZb!nLY7TaJ_tH01Iestl_BbfIpu9nmwx6opP02R6cIt_1A),
extract to a sub-folder of your Warcraft III installation (also called
GProxyVarlock[^3]).

##### GproxyGhostGraz

Download from
[GitHub](https://github.com/MisterVector/gproxy-ghostgraz/releases),
extract to a sub-folder of your Warcraft III installation[^4].

#### Mana bars

A nice addition to later Warcraft III is mana bars displayed underneath
health bars, you can [download a
plugin](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oh_V5mbaNED5aw3WhsPCTdxY7BJO8cKn/view)
that enables this. Just drop the .mix file into the folder you extracted
Warcraft III to.

### Hosting a game

[Aura++](https://github.com/Josko/aura-bot), a modern implementation of
the Ghost++ bot, is running as *Swat55* with the trigger *!*. It is
currently missing a proper configuration for Swat, so games cannot be
autohosted or by command. This shouldn't be that difficult, I just
haven't gotten fully comprehended the map-configuration. Other
alternatives are any of the
[Ghost++](https://github.com/teller55/SwatGhost) forks that can compile
on Linux and work with \>=1.28.\* ([most recent
implementation](https://github.com/AiStudent/ghost-ent-bt/tree/ver28_sg)
I can find), or the [OHSystem](https://github.com/m-unkel/OHSystem).

Though it should not matter much, the PvPGN-network and bot is running
from Newark, NJ on the following virtual machine:

-   2 GB RAM
-   1 CPU Core
-   30 GB SSD Storage
-   2 TB Transfer
-   40 Gbps Network In
-   1000 Mbps Network Out
