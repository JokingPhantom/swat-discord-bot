    10 Nanites
    8 Laser + 4 dissipation (scale as needed with zombie mob HP)

    4 gen
    19 Nanites
    4 deflection
    1 nurse (get before Nemesis spawns)

With high intelligence, FCWM is a good choice for off tank. 19 Nanites, Shield Capacitor, 4 Deflection, and 4 Aux. Gen.

11 Points into X-Grenade gives maximum Commando killing power, and gives additional Priority Control and Crowd Control.

FCWM is a good unit to deal with the enemy Mini-Droids that Nemesis spawns.

    The Laser damage from FCWM destroys Minis rapidly.
    X-Grenade is good at destroying Spider mines that spawn from the Mini-Droid's death.
    Try to time it so that the grenade lands right after the enemy Mini-Droid is destroyed.

8 Laser and 4 Dissipation gives great Priority Control and boss DPS.

1 Nurse protects from slays and spider bombs.

This is a skill point intensive build - Mental Clarity support from a Psychologist is required to reliably reach the number of skill points required.

Sacrifice a few points in X-Grenade/ Laser if there aren't enough skill points to go around.

Use high int items, bandages, stims, and speeds to boost firepower, energy regen and healing ability.
