Build:
Healer, Triage, Heavy, Hacking

Skill Build:
1 MC, 1 Moti, rest Nanites
16 MC
10 Nanites
8 Moti
14 Nanites
Rest into Confidence or Nanites

Spread MC between 3 different players. 
When in doubt, ask an experienced player what the order should be.
Most builds complete at LVL 36, getting as many late game scaling builds to that threshold is the most valuable use of MC.
Rough Order of priority for MC: Non-SL Mecha, below LVL20 Reckless HO/Tech/WM/Sniper, Drug GAL/WM/Sniper, High Attack Speed Players, Tech.
It's good to use more than 24 points into focii, since extra points are necessary to balance between 150/165 int and 16 Conf/8 Moti
End game you should have enough int for 150 int items, 165 Chrono int if necessary. Then spread your skill points into Conf/Moti, unless there are no good Conf targets, then it's max Moti and rest MC.
You should be LVL 41 around the same time as your teammates reaching LVL 36, given psy's 33% innate EXP bonus from Rank 12.

Example Nemesis Spawn build, LVL 40:
142 base int + 8 MC int = 150 int
19 Nanites
28 points in Focii: 8 MC, 16 Conf, 4 Moti
