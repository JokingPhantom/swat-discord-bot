Getting your Robodog to level 8 is going to be your first priority, to give it more regen, cap, armor, evasion, and vitality.

Keep dog on max vitality.

16 points in dog gives it 1000e cap.

1 point in grenade helps deal with innards and gives a little bit of CC.

Use your sniper rifle to shoot gray zombies on your dog.

Stand next to your dog to give it bonus regen - this bonus scales on your hero's advance gen, so be sure to level that up as much as possible.

Points into Mecha beyond 16 gives a bit more evasion and vitality, helpful for high man Extinction games.

Gadgeteer + Cyber allows you to use your own Riot Shield and a Combat Vest 2, giving your hero and dog more armor to tank.

Make sure your dog, hero, and locker has batteries to help tank in difficult situations. Request them from your QM whenever your team has the money to buy it. Get them yourself from ABMs whenever you pass by.

Solo C+K Light/Chaingun/RadResist/Espionage/Running Spend 1 point in gun and 8 points in nade right away.

Reprogram your dog into nanites while moving haz so that you can safely keep mob off of you.
