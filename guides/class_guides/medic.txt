Guide:
Turn Health bars on
Use Mend to heal HP in normal situations
Use Bandages for burst healing in dangerous situations
Use Nano to heal people almost dead/emergencies
Use Rapid Therapy to cure injuries, including Severe Injuries
Use Revive skill to revive dead people ASAP
Use Adrenaline on your teammate who has best gun, for DPS or for crowd control

When Nano is high enough, it also cures non-severe injuries, and cures rez sickness.

Medics avoid dying at all costs. Avoid taking hits, micro your attack so that you don't draw aggro.
Adjust your level of early mend between 2-8, based on how much healing your group needs. 

Item Priority:
Dotes
Bandages
Batteries
Gen
Cap

Medic functions best with at least 1500e cap and some extra regen. 
At most, Medic needs to output 38 eps worth of healing (continuous mender + nano), not including burst reviving for 250e per hero.
Medic healing comes in waves, not very constant, so cap and gen are both important to have, and batteries are key for burst healing situations.
