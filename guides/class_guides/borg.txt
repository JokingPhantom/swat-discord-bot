Borg is a high energy class that tanks in bursts pre-Nemesis, so Duo-Cells are the best pre-Nemesis items, with integrated MFGs and other spare regen.
The 1st set of batteries the group gets should go into your inventory, or into your locker if you have 5 items + dotes.
You can locker 2 sets of batteries early very reasonably. Be ready to pull them out for hard situations.
The 1st Combat Vest should go to you. Upgrade to CV II ASAP
You should receive the SCAP as the 1st top secret, unless Tech Ops is in the game and has an available Riot Shield User.
Keep Pheromones charged at all times, ready to save the group, or for pushing through dangerous map mob.
Be prepared to use Force Field to tank TNTs that can't be otherwise handled, or for extreme tanking in difficult situations.
By Nemesis, you should have switched your inventory to CV II, SCAP, Pluses, and Batteries, and your locker should have 2 sets of locker batteries ready.
Riot Shield should be used on you by 30-50 minutes.
