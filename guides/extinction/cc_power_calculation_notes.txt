Building Optimal CCs can be formulated as a needs satisfaction, or optimization game (e.g. using Dantzig's simplex algorithm).

Propose the following base attributes for a CC:

1. Nemesis DPS
2. Boss DPS
3. Crowd Control
4. Main Tank
5. Off Tank ability
6. Priority Control
7. Healing power
8. Reactor objective power
9. Civilian objective power
10. Rad objective power
11. Room clearing power
12. Group Strategic Movement speed
13. SRAD/Blue Rad objective power
14. Hazmat objective power
15. Clutch power

Propose the following intermediate attributes, which serve as intermediaries for other traits:
1. Gold supply/demand
2. Item supply/demand
3. Top Secert Item usage capabilities
4. Mini Droid MKII usage capabilities
5. LAD usage capabilities


These attributes possess a complex relationship, that then translates to the following:

1. Group stability/ chances of not wiping at any given moment
2. Group win speed

The goal is to build a CC that wins as fast as possible, while maintaining as much stability as possible to reduce failed games and wasted time.
Individual classes and builds contribution a certain amount to each attribute, and combinations of classes/builds can contribute more or less together, than they otherwise would individually.

Initial rough draft for attribute values for any given class:

* Tech Ops:
Base attributes:
+1 Tank power
+2 Offtank power (+1 CPU/ +1 other robots)
+3 Nemesis DPS
+1 Boss DPS
+3 Crowd Control
+1 Priority Control
+2 Reactor objective power
+-1 Group Strategic Movement speed
+1 SRAD/Blue Rad objective power
+1/0 Clutch power

Intermediate attributes:
-4 Gold supply/demand
-2 Item supply/demand
Freeze ray user
Riot user
+3 Mini droid MKII usage capabilities
+3 LAD usage capabilities

The biggest possible cornerstone of a team. A fully built robotic army is incredibly expensive, but is a very versatile and strong durable resource for the team.
CPU can serve as the main tank in a full house extinction, but this requires high levels of coordination to reduce Nemesis Damage, destroy Commandos, and high levels of Crowd Control.
Also puts a burden on QM needs, since it can require anywhere between 15-17 items, and 10-30-42 circuit boards
