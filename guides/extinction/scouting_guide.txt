Scouting Guide
Estimated Par Times to all solo objectives cleared:
80 minutes, regular solo, no short scouts
70 minutes, regular solo, no short scouts, group clears 20%
60 minutes, regular solo, 1 short scout clears 20%, group clears 20%
50 minutes, regular solo, 2 short scouts clear 40%, group clears 20%
40 minutes, SHO, 2 short scout clears 30%, group clears 15%
Horror spawns can delay rad clear by 2-10 minutes, depending on how much radiation is added.
Red rad spawns and missed Sgargs can delay rad clear by spawning an additional rad.

6 exo pieces (25% for game to spawn exosuit pieces. Can be placed together with any other room except ABMs/Reactors)

1 Large Hazmat Room
2 Single Hazmat Rooms
Note: Hazmat rooms can be placed together with each other and item rooms, but not ABMs/Reactors

1 Shroom Room (spawns late, a couple minutes after difficulty is set)

1 Blue Rad (any rad on the map is eligible to change to it)
1 Rad room (this room gets 5-20 extra rads)

After difficulty changes to EXT/NM, several seconds must elapse before rads turn into yellow/red rads. 
Killing rads before rads change color/extra rads based on difficulty spawn will cause them to respawn.

Park
1 ChronoTech Corporation Box


Graveyard
Hazmats

Paths:
Outer loop
Middle loop left
Middle loop right
Middle map
Plaza
Main group loop rooms (lower priority for solo because group will naturally scout these in 90% of games)
Hard to get rooms (solo should ignore pathing to these early because they slow you down. Great ion targets)

GY Haz Drag

Guide:
SHO can maintain 3 minis easily while filling batts early. 4 minis if lucky. 2 minis if really unlucky with room spawns.
SHO can take outer loop, mid map, and one of the middle loop paths. Then get the other middle loop path, hard to get rooms, missed rooms.

WM should take outher loop paths for lower room spawns
Snipers should take middle loop paths or middle map due to higher difficulty of those rooms
Techs should take middle loop paths.
Borgs can take middle map or middle loop paths.

Items can be moved to main group path, Bunkers, Reactors, ABMs.
Haz can also be dragged to main group path, Bunkers, Reactors.
80% of games should have group recalling some haz, it's usually more efficient.
Teleporting recall to solo temporarily is a great way to clear haz or large item rooms + locker, saving time.

Having 2-3 short scouts early with solo helps kill rads very fast. Group should be able to clear gy mob with adren/stims/aoe/drugs/turn up the heat/etc.
