Most common ways to wipe during Nemesis:
1. Spider Mines. Drop aggro, shoot non-boss, hold fire, move away.
2. Tanking Nemesis as a non-tanking class. Never shoot Nemesis unless you are ready to tank Nemesis. Immedietely hold fire or shoot mob if you need to drop aggro.
3. Splash on people standing on Mini Droids. Everyone should manually control their attack target. No attack move or standing still.
4. Splash on people standing on Spider Mines. Everyone should manually control their attack target. No attack move or standing still.
5. Umbrellas shooting the team to death. It's not possible to reliably drop aggro when umbrellas are at close range, so its a DPS race.
6. Wimps, tank dies, team dies. Tank, Off Tank, Healer, and Freeze Ray must use batteries ASAP
7. Mind Slay with no Buffouts, Surged Nurse, Mender
8. No Batteries left to use
9. Fly Abom killing stunned people. Drop aggro before killing an abom, to avoid Nemesis Stun.
10. Commandos shooting the team to death
11. Know Your Name

Easy tips to not wipe during Nemesis:
1. Attacking the right target. Do not tank and waste batteries if you are not a tank. Tank should always attack a boss. Squishy team members should shoot mob, or not shoot at all. Nobody except for Mini/Spider control roles should shoot minis or spiders.
2. Stop shooting when you need to remain unstunned for freeze/recall. All units that are shooting are susceptible to being stunned at any moment. Move away from shooting allies to avoid taking EMP AOE or Rocket AOE (Rocket multi-target is AOE based on a single attacking unit)
3. Every team member should have locker batts. Pull them in to save the tank/healer/DPS, even if it's just to give those batteries to someone else.
